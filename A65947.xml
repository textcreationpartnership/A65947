            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A LETTER to Dr. <hi>SHERLOCK,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE preſent Controverſie concerning the Caſe of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of theſe two parts; as it reſpects the Story it ſelf, and as it reſpects the <hi>Convocation</hi>'s Senſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As it reſpects the Story it ſelf;
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 5</note> and here I had urged two Things: 1. <hi>That it is ſuſpitious.</hi> And, 2. <hi>If it were true, it would not prove what it is alleadged for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Story it ſelf is ſuſpitious.</hi> And here it is ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that what I deſigned to prove, was that the Story of <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> as it is repreſented by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> is <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>ſuſpitious,</hi> and not that it is abſolutely <hi>falſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 12.</note> the <hi>Doubtfulneſs</hi> of it being ſufficient to my purpoſe; which was to ſhew,
<q>That no Argument can be drawn from the Example of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> to juſtifie Submiſſion to a Poſſeſſour of Power, notwithſtanding an Oath to a lawfull King, who is alive, and inſiſts upon his Right.</q> This is the uſe which ſome Men make of it, and which our <hi>Author</hi> vindicates: And the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty</hi> of the Story is a good Argument againſt that, though it be not charged with direct Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: For if it be <hi>onely ſuſpitious,</hi> it may be true, or it may be falſe; but if it be <hi>onely ſuſpitious,</hi> it cannot be argumentative; and no regular Inference can be drawn from it, in reference to Practice; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly that which I draw from thence is,
<note place="margin">P. 9.</note>
               <q>That it is very unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to make an Argument, or draw any Inference, in reference to Practice, from ſuch a <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> Story.—</q> The <hi>Suſpition</hi> affects the Exemplarineſs of it, as much as the direct <hi>Falſhood;</hi> and a <hi>doubtfull</hi> Example is as unſerviceable to make a Precedent, as one that is notoriouſly <hi>falſe:</hi> So that in this Controverſie there is ſome Difference between this <hi>Author</hi> and my ſelf. It is not neceſſary for me to prove the Story falſe; but it is neceſſary for him, and all that urge this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or act upon it, or produce it to countenance their Practices, to prove it <hi>true,</hi> and to clear it from thoſe Doubts and Difficulties with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40132:3"/>which it is encumbred; which notwithſtanding our <hi>Author</hi> is ſo far from doing, that, if poſſible, he hath made it more intricate and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than it was before.</p>
            <p>In order to make this Charge good againſt him, I ſhall onely premiſe, (and which he does not deny,) That this Story ſtands purely upon the Credit and Authority of <hi>Joſephus;</hi> now if this Author himſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his pretending to vindicate <hi>Joſephus,</hi> does give as little Credit to <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Chronology as I do, if the Account that he hath given makes <hi>Joſephus</hi> as much miſtaken as that which I have given; then he himſelf, for all his fair Words of him, reflects as much upon <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and in the Civility of his own Language makes him a <hi>Lyar;</hi> and that I hope is no extraordinary Reaſon to relie upon his Authority,
<note place="margin">P. 12.</note> nor to draw a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Inference from an Example that ſtands upon nothing elſe but the Relation of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> And this is plainly the Caſe in the Account this Author gives of the times in which <hi>Ezra,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> lived, which differs from <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Account but <hi>ninety</hi> and odd Years, as we ſhall ſee preſently; ſo that for any thing I can ſee, the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> though the Author lays it down as the Foundation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, is in truth no Diſpute between us; for he himſelf regards his Authority as little as I do, onely he differs from him in one Inſtance, and I in another; but that I think is not much, with reſpect to the Authority of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> The Author indeed, to ſmooth the buſineſs, calls his Book <hi>A Vindication of</hi> Joſephus; and if he had pleaſed, he might have called it <hi>A Confutation of</hi> Joſephus, and it would have done as well; for it is but a ſcurvy kind of <hi>Vindication,</hi> when to vindicate one Paſſage in an Author, a Man is forced to impeach his Credit as much in another: So that if our Author has any thing to ſay for the Story, I deſire him for his own ſake, hereafter not to tell his Adverſary, <hi>That his Complaint of Difficulties proceeded onely from an eager deſire to find faults in that Story of</hi> Joſephus,
<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> except he himſelf could vindicate <hi>that Story,</hi> without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many and as great Faults in another Story of the ſame <hi>Joſephus.</hi> I deſire him likewiſe not to build too much on the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> except he can give us a Reaſon why the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Joſephus</hi> is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable in the Caſe of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> but of no value at all in the Caſe of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to doe our Author Juſtice, he hath as little to ſay for the <hi>Story</hi> it ſelf, as he hath for the Authority of <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and this will appear upon Examining what he ſays in the <hi>Vindication.</hi> He begins with what I ſay of the <hi>Suſpitiouſneſs</hi> of the Story,
<note place="margin">P. 2.</note> and my firſt Argument he tells us was, That,</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Author beſides <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and thoſe that had it from him, <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or takes notice</hi> of any ſuch thing. Now this our Author does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and an indifferent Man at firſt ſight would be apt to imagine that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40132:3"/>this was a conſiderable Prejudice againſt any Story vouched by a ſingle Author, eſpecially if the Matter of it be of extraordinary Remark, and eminently merits the notice of an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> as is the Caſe before us: And when I mentioned ſuch grave Authors, and of undoubted Credit, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, Quintus Curtius, Arrian,</hi> and <hi>Juſtin,</hi> who have tranſmitted to us the whole Progreſs of <hi>Alexander,</hi> none of which have the leaſt word or intimation, either of <hi>Jaddus</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though if the Story be true, it is the moſt famous and memorable part of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Hiſtory; one would have thought there ſhould have been ſome plain and clear Reaſon given of their Pretermiſſion, before ſuch a Story be admitted for authentick, and more eſpecially before it be inſiſted on to juſtifie Practice in a moſt high and important Caſe. But all this is nothing with our Author, and he wipes it out with a wet Finger: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this Argument lies againſt all that</hi> Joſephus <hi>has written of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Affairs, within the Hiſtorical Time of the Heathens, except what he takes out of</hi> Scripture, <hi>and out of the Books of the</hi> Maccabees; <hi>for we have no other antient</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> And why ſo, I pray? Was the Hiſtory of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> a Hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh Affairs?</hi> Or, was the Conqueſt of <hi>Judaea</hi> confined to the Countrey, and a Secret to all the World beſides? As <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the Story, the whole Scene was acted in the Face of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Army, and to their great wonderment; and of thoſe that were preſent the Foreigners were far more numerous: And yet forſooth, a thing ſo remarkable in itſelf, and, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells it, ſo particularly remark'd, and ſo notorious and publick, our Author would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be Matter onely of National Record, and could by no means get out of the Territories of <hi>Judaea.</hi> And he talks of the Conqueſt of a Countrey, as if it had been like their municipal Laws, and particular Cuſtoms, and known to none but the Natives and Inhabitants: And accordingly he tells us, <hi>If there had been any other</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Hiſtorian, that had written the Things of</hi> Alexander<hi>'s Time, and ſaid nothing of this Story of</hi> Jaddus, <hi>nor of</hi> Jaddus <hi>himſelf, (for his living is then queſtioned by our Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,) then indeed there had been great occaſion to ſay, that their Silence had made this Story ſuſpitious; but when there is no</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Writer, that pretends to write a Hiſtory of thoſe Times, in this Caſe to argue againſt the Authority of</hi> Joſephus, <hi>onely from the Silence of</hi> Heathen <hi>Hiſtorians, this ſeems to be very unjuſt and unreaſonable.</hi> Now as to <hi>Jewiſh Hiſtorians</hi> writing of the <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Time, the Author I think is a little miſtaken; for the Author of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Maccab,</hi> ch. 1.</note> who wrote much nearer the Time of <hi>Alexander</hi> than <hi>Joſephus,</hi> hath taken notice of the Things of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Time,</hi> and makes it introductory to his Book, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Affairs of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and yet he takes as little notice of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>'s coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or his ſubduing it, as the <hi>Heathen Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> themſelves: And <hi>Julius Africanus,</hi> who, as our Author ſaith, lived
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40132:4"/>in that Country, and wrote ſome time after <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and ſays nothing of this Story neither;
<note place="margin">P. 9, 10.</note> and our Author ſays, <hi>that living in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he might have his Information from them that knew as well as</hi> Joſephus <hi>himſelf:</hi> So that if our Author thinks it ſo very material, the <hi>Jewiſh Hiſtorians</hi> alſo are perfectly ſilent in this Matter. But why <hi>Jewiſh Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian?</hi> Could no body take notice of the Conqueſt of <hi>Judaea</hi> by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> but a <hi>Jew,</hi> and a Conqueſt more conſiderable than all the reſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended with ſuch wonderful and ſtupendious Circumſtances? I grant him that neither <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> nor <hi>Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>Jews,</hi> nor did they undertake to write the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory; but they wrote the Life and Expedition of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and this is a conſiderable part of that; and I wonder what Reaſon can be given, why they ſhould pretermit the extraordinary Conqueſt and Submiſſion of <hi>Judaea,</hi> any more than they did the Conqueſt of <hi>Tyre, Egypt, Perſia,</hi> or <hi>India;</hi> for neither were theſe Authors <hi>Tyrians, Egyptians, Perſians,</hi> nor <hi>Indians.</hi> And it is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, that thoſe who deſcend to ſuch minute Circumſtances, to his Sleep, Dreams, taking Phyſick, ſhould yet ſilently paſs over the moſt remarkable Paſſage of the whole, and which deſerved the Notice and Record of an Hiſtorian, as much or more than the Battel at <hi>Iſſus,</hi> or at <hi>Gauſomela,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. p. 6.</note> or any other matter whatſoever. This I had ſaid before, and I am ſorry I am forced to repeat it; but the force of the Argument lies in it, and our Author was not pleaſed to take the leaſt notice of it: He ſpeaks here (by way of diminution and abatement to their Credit) of the Silence of <hi>Heathen</hi> Hiſtorians; But why <hi>Heathen Hiſtorians?</hi> The Queſtion is a <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and no Article of Religion; and I did not know before that a <hi>Right Faith</hi> was neceſſary to make a good Hiſtorian; and if that would make any alteration in the Caſe, <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf was a <hi>Jew.</hi> But let us hear his Reaſon, <hi>Who knows not that the</hi> Heathens <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally contemned and hated the</hi> Jews, <hi>as being not onely Revilers of their gods, but Enemies to all the reſt of Mankind?</hi> Why truly, to anſwer that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I doubt <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf did not know it; for he hath taken a great deal of Pains to prove the contrary, and to repreſent the great <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> that was paid to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Heathen Nations,</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may find in ſeveral places of his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> and more eſpecially in his Book againſt <hi>Appion.</hi> And I am ſomewhat in doubt whether our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>knows</hi> it; for to ſolve an Inconſiſtency in this Story, noted by <hi>Salian,</hi> he tells us, <hi>The</hi> Chaldaeans, <hi>who after ſo long acquaintance as they had with the</hi> Jews <hi>in their Captivity, were kinder to them than any other People, and have continued ſo ever ſince.</hi> Now as I take it, theſe <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> were <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> as well as other People. He tells us farther, That, excepting the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who might doe it upon a point of Intereſt, upon the ſcore of Trade, <hi>no other Nation could be ſo intent upon the Spoils of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but only for ſpite.</hi> And adds, <hi>of all the Nations in the World none ſo likely as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40132:4"/>the</hi> Samaritans. So then it ſeems by his own reckoning, this <hi>Hatred</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> was not ſo <hi>general</hi> as he would here inſinuate, and though a ſpiteful <hi>Samaritan</hi> might be ſuſpected of Partiality or Malice, either in declaring or omitting matters relating to the Affairs of <hi>Judaea,</hi> there is no reaſon to extend this to all the reſt of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World; and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> and the other Authors before mentioned, were not <hi>Samaritans</hi> no more than they were <hi>Jews.</hi> But the truth is, this Buſineſs of the <hi>general Hatred of the Heathens to the Jews</hi> is meer Imagination, and hath no Foundation but in the Author's Fancy, for however it may have been ſince the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and their general Diſperſion, and which as a juſt Judgment of God is fallen upon them for their crucifying the Lord of Life, and concerns <hi>Heathens</hi> no more than it does <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> yet before (and <hi>Diodorus</hi> wrote 160 Years before) no Nation in the World was ſo much admired, and ſought to, and particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Rites and Religion, (the very Reaſon our Author gives of their Hatred to them,) and beſides the many Inſtances of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the infinite number of Proſelytes, both of the <hi>Gates</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is a demonſtration of it; and (which is not leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) the Eaſtern and the European Learning was derived from them; and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who ſet up for Learning and Improvement in Philoſophy, particularly <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi>

<note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
               <hi>it is found in Writing that the</hi> Spartans <hi>and</hi> Jews <hi>are Brethren, and come out of the Generation of</hi> Abraham. Now this, and a great deal more that might be ſaid if it were needful, is no great Evidence of that <hi>general Hatred and Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which our Author, for want of a better Anſwer, charges upon the <hi>Heathens.</hi> But to gratify him let us ſuppoſe it, and what then? Why, then they would not ſpeak the Truth of them, even though they knew it, and though it lay never ſo much in the Courſe of the Hiſtory they treat of. This I muſt confeſs is round dealing, and at one ſtroke daſhes out all their Reputation, and faſtens as black an Imputation upon them as can be laid upon any Hiſtorian: and methinks our Author who is ſo ready to charge theſe eminent Men with Hatred, and conſequent upon that with Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſhould have had ſome good Reaſon ready to have cleared his own in this Point; for if it be Inſincerity in an Hiſtorian to omit a pertinent Paſſage, out of meer Hatred to the Perſons concerned, 'tis ſomething or other which I will not name, to charge an Hiſtorian with ſuch woful Prevarication, and offer nothing at all in proof of it. And what hath our Author to ſupport this foul Charge? Why truly 'tis all built on one Word, 'tis but calling them <hi>Heathen</hi> Hiſtorians and the Buſineſs is done, and then 'tis as clear as can be, they are guilty of Hatred, Malice, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, Unfaithfulneſs, and all the Vices. And if the Reader will not take this for a very good Reaſon why thoſe Authors omitted this Story of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> I cannot help it, our Author will not afford us any better. He adds indeed, and perhaps he intended it for a Reaſon, <hi>Hence it came to paſs that thoſe Writers he mentions, have ſcarce ever named the</hi> Jews <hi>in their Hiſtories.</hi> A very weighty Reaſon indeed, and therefore they muſt needs <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>contemn</hi> them, by the ſame Reaſon our Author <hi>hates Plutarch, Arrian, Curtius</hi> and <hi>Juſtin,</hi> for neither doth he <hi>name</hi> them, though the preſent Diſpute is concerning them. But this Author has an excellent Faculty at turning his Reaſons, but four Lines before it was very <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable to argue againſt the Authority of</hi> Joſephus, <hi>only from the ſilence of</hi> Heathen <hi>Hioſtrians.</hi> But now it ſeems their <hi>Silence</hi> is all in all, and the whole Fabrick ſtands upon it, and it is <hi>very juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> from thence to argue againſt their own Authority, and to make them guilty of Baſeneſs; that is to ſay, this ſame <hi>Silence</hi> anſwers as many purpoſes as the <hi>Author</hi> pleaſes; they do not mention a Story that <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> does, and then they are a parcel of <hi>Heathens,</hi> and their <hi>Silence</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing at all: They do not mention the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Hiſtories, and then they are <hi>Heathens</hi> too; but their <hi>Silence</hi> ſignifies Hatred, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Want of Fidelity, and I cannot tell what. Well! No body knows what Wonders the ſame thing can do, when it falls into the hands of a Man of Art and Argument: But after all this is pure Miſtake; for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40132:5"/>if the <hi>naming</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> will take off this Imputation, and abate our Author's heavy Charge, they have not been ſo backward in that: 'Tis true indeed they do not go out of their way to name them, and when they have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which, how kind ſoever it might be, would not be very pertinent in an Hiſtorian; and I ſuppoſe they choſe rather to mind the Courſe of their Hiſtory, than to digreſs, and mix things foreign, out of pure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to the <hi>Jews.</hi> But however, if naming the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Writings will reconcile them to out Author's better opinion, if he pleaſe to look again, he will find that ſome of them have <hi>named</hi> them indeed no oftener than they had occaſion: <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath a whole Diſcourſe concerning them in his <hi>Sympoſiacs,</hi> in which there is nothing ſavouring either of Hatred or Diſreſpect to them: Neither hath he forgot them in his <hi>Lives,</hi> but hath mentioned them more than once; and, which comes home to our Purpoſe,
<note place="margin">In Pompeis.</note> he records <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Entrance into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and his taking <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his deciding Controverſies there, and many other Affairs, by himſelf and his Officers: And I wonder why this very ſame <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſhould in his Life of <hi>Pompey</hi> take particular Notice of the Affairs of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Tranſactions there; and yet in his Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> take no manner of Notice of his being at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> eſpecially ſince his being there was, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſo extraordinary and wonderfull: I doubt the reaſon is, that he had heard of the one, but not of the other. Our Author adds, <hi>But</hi> Joſephus <hi>deſigned nothing more than to give us a Hiſtory of the</hi> Jews; even juſt as the other Hiſtorians deſigned nothing more than to give us a Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And if it be reaſonable to think <hi>Joſephus</hi> would omit nothing that was material and extraordinary in the hiſtory of his Nation, I hope it is as reaſonable to think thoſe other Hiſtorians would omit nothing that was very material and extraordinary in the Life of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But this our Author will not allow; for he adds, <hi>How then ſhould</hi> Joſephus'<hi>s Credit be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht by the ſilence of</hi> Heathen Writers, <hi>eſpecially in a matter which they would be ſure to conceal, for that very reaſon that he had to mention is, namely, becauſe it made for the honour of his Nation?</hi> Now this, if it be a Reaſon, it has two Edges; for if the Reaſon of concealing might be the <hi>Hatred</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Reaſon of mentioning it might be for the <hi>Honour</hi> of them; then the Queſtion is, Whether it be moſt likely, that the <hi>Honour</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might tempt <hi>Joſephus</hi> to ſpeak more than truth; or the <hi>Hatred</hi> to it might prevail upon all the reſt to ſpeak leſs than Truth of them? Now I can tell our <hi>Author,</hi> that it is no new Complaint, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath been a little too carefull of the <hi>Honour</hi> of his Nation; and it is not very accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how ſo many ſeveral Authors, and of divers Ages and Nations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to give account of the whole Expedition of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhould all of them combine to omit a moſt famous and remarkable Submiſſion to him, out of pure <hi>Spight</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> to the Inhabitants. But the truth is, our <hi>Author</hi> is ſo very tender of the Credit of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that he cares not what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40132:6"/>he ſays, nor how much he reflects on the Reputation of other Hiſtorians, every way as good, or better than him; and to ſupport <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they muſt be repreſented by odious and abominable Characters, and as <hi>deſignedly</hi> and <hi>malitiouſly</hi> concealing plain Matter of Fact; and all this without any manner of Proof, either from the Authors themſelves, or from any other Reaſon, but onely out of pure charitable Conjecture and Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> This Author tells me, <hi>We ought to take heed of ſuch Arguments as an Adverſary may make uſe of againſt the Goſpel it ſelf;</hi> and I ſay ſo we ought: And though the Compariſon is not equal, yet there is great reaſon to take heed of ſuch Inſinuations as deſtroy the Credit of all Hiſtory; for if a Man without direct and plain Proofs may faſten ſuch Imputations upon Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the ſame Conjectures may as well affect what they deliver, as what they do not; and ſo we may quickly conjecture the Truth of all Hiſtory out of the World: 'Tis but boldly charging them with <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> and the Work is done, and a Teſtimony from Hiſtory will ſignifie no more than the Authority of a <hi>Romance.</hi> And if <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Credit in this point cannot be maintained any other way, in my poor Opinion it had better ſhift for itſelf as well as it can, than to ſit thus hard on the Reputation and Vertue of as good Hiſtorians perhaps as the World hath ſeen: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude this point, and as a farther Confirmation of my Aſſertion, I ſhall conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The general Credit and Reputation thoſe Hiſtorians have always had among learned Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The particular Advantages they had of informing themſelves of the true Account of the Hiſtory and Expedition of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Their general Credit and Reputation among learned Men. Now this is a copious Argument, and a great deal may be ſaid of it; but to ſave the Readers Pains and my own, and not to tranſcribe more than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, any Man may be ſatisfied what Opinion the learned World hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had of them by thoſe excellent Characters given of them, publiſhed and annexed to their reſpective Writings, and more particularly in <hi>Veſſius de Hiſtoricis Graecis &amp; Latinis,</hi> where the Reader may find ſuch Encomiums of their Diligence, Skill, and Fidelity, as will not eaſily be match'd by the Characters given by learned Men of any other Hiſtorians.

And (to ſay no more) theſe Writers are the moſt eminent Perſons that have eſcaped the great Shipwrack of Learning, and to whom we owe more of the Knowledge
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40132:6"/>we have, here in the Weſt, of antient times, than to all the Authors in the World, excepting the Penmen of the holy Books: And their Reputation, as Hiſtorians, hath always been not onely ſo clear, but ſo great and auguſt, that a Man would wonder what ſhould make our Author treat them ſo courſly, and give ſuch a ſcandalous Account of them, as if they were acted by irregular and undue Paſſions, and in the writing their Hiſtories were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> and not according to the trueſt ſtate of things they were able to come to the knowledge of. Such things as theſe, one would think, eſpecially from a Man that pretends to <hi>vindicate</hi> an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> ſhould not onely have been barely <hi>ſuggeſted,</hi> but <hi>proved,</hi> at leaſt offered to be <hi>proved;</hi> for a Man that writes Paradoxes, againſt the Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the World, is bound in Juſtice to himſelf to give ſome Reaſon for it, if he have any to give; and I dare be bold to ſay, that no Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our Author, ever charged theſe Hiſtorians with ſuch a ſcandalous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; but on the contrary ſpeak of them not only with all imaginable Candour, but Veneration alſo, with reſpect to their Character of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The particular Advantages theſe Hiſtorians had of informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the true Account of the Expedition of <hi>Alexander:</hi> And that was an opportunity of conſulting thoſe Authors who were followers of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and Eye-Witneſſes of his Actions; and thoſe we have an account of are <hi>Ariſtobulus, Clitarchus, Oneſicritus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagi;</hi> which laſt was one of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s great Captains, and after his Death King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Theſe were perſonally acquainted with the Story of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and had conſign'd it to Writing, whoſe Writings theſe Hiſtorians conſulted, and from whom reſpectively they extracted their Hiſtories. <hi>Diodorus</hi> mentions <hi>Clitarchus;

Theſe then were the Authors our <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and they compiled their reſpective Hiſtories out of the Writings of thoſe very Men, who were <hi>Eye-Witneſſes</hi> to what they delivered, and were all of them <hi>Companions</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Expedition, and one of them in a moſt eminent Station and Place of Truſt under him. And now I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all the World, and to the Author himſelf, if ſuch a joint Omiſſion of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Story, vouched but by a <hi>ſingle</hi> Author, be not ſufficient to make
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40132:7"/>that <hi>Story ſuſpitious;</hi> for otherwiſe one of theſe three things muſt follow: Either that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who wrote 400 Years after; knew better what was done than thoſe that were <hi>Eye-Witneſſes;</hi> or, that ſeveral <hi>Eye-Witneſſes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to write a Story, ſhould all of them, either wilfully and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or through negligence or inadvertence, omit the moſt obſervable Paſſage in the whole; or, that other Hiſtorians of undoubted Credit, and living in ſeveral Ages, and in divers Nations, and being of differing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Intereſts, and each of them conſulting and tranſcribing out of the Writings of thoſe <hi>Eye-Witneſſes,</hi> ſhould all of them unanimouſly omit one ſingle Story, of very great Note, and which had been particularly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Authors they conſulted; and this without the leaſt Proof that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them actually did ſo, and which is founded onely on an inevident and preſumptive Malice, which they had in their Hearts. How willing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome Men are to impoſe upon themſelves, I deſie the moſt credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and eaſie Man alive to believe either of theſe, if he can. Men had need complain of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Party,</hi> that offer ſuch things as theſe for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>It was the ſame Reaſon that they had to paſs by all the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; ſhould we therefore grant the Story of theſe to be ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe the Heathen Writers of thoſe times take no Notice of any ſuch thing?</hi> But how does the Author know, that the Heathen Writers of thoſe times did paſs by the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles out of <hi>Malice</hi> to them and to the Chriſtian Religion? Might it not be done out of Miſtake, want of due Information, Incredulity, or becauſe it was foreign to the Matter of their Hiſtory? Some of theſe I ſuppoſe may paſs for as good Reaſons as <hi>Malice.</hi> But let that be as it will, it is nothing at all to the purpoſe; for the Caſes are by no means parallel upon many accounts: For, 1. The Reaſon and Ground of my Objection was not the mere Silence of theſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, but their Silence in ſuch Matters as not onely relate to, but make a mighty Figure in the Hiſtory they treat of; and in ſuch Caſes their Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is an Argument of Suſpition, though their bare Omiſſion be not: And therefore to make our <hi>Author</hi>'s Anſwer reach the Caſe, we muſt ſuppoſe, that the Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> was the immediate ſubject of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Hiſtories, as the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> was of theſe <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> and then indeed their omitting the Miracles, and moſt remarkable Inſtances of their Lives, would have made the Caſes of Omiſſion parallel; but this is a little too wild for any Man to ſuppoſe. And what a pure Conſequence is this! The Omiſſion of the moſt memorable Paſſage in the Life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by thoſe <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> who wrote the Life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> is an Argument that that Story is ſuſpitious; and therefore the Omiſſion of the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by thoſe Hiſtorians who do not write their Lives, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an Argument of the ſame Suſpition. But if this, as inconſequent as it is, was allowed our Authour, it would not ſerve his Purpoſe: For,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40132:7"/> 2. There is a great Difference in the Authority: 'Tis true, the Heathen Writers taking no Notice of the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is no reaſon to grant, that therefore they are ſuſpitious; nor yet would it be any reaſon, if they had expreſſed the clean contrary: But the reaſon of that is, becauſe they have the Teſtimony of Writings divinely inſpired, and the Authority of which cannot be impeach'd by the Aſſertions, and much leſs by the Silence of all the Heathens in the World. But what is this to the Authority of <hi>Joſephus?</hi> Does that ſtand upon as clear a bottom as the Scriptures? And where I wonder is the conſequence, becauſe the Silence of Heathen Writers is nothing againſt the Authority of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> therefore it is alſo nothing againſt the Authority of <hi>Joſephus?</hi> And therefore this is nothing to the purpoſe, except the Authority of <hi>Joſephus</hi> was as ſacred and infallible as the Scriptures themſelves. And therefore if our Author would make the Caſes parallel, he muſt ſuppoſe that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſtood onely upon humane Teſtimony, and then ſuppoſe five Heathen Hiſtorians, of undoubted Credit, ſhould profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly undertake to write the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, and one ſingle Chriſtian, of no better Credit than they in point of Hiſtory, ſhould take notice of one ſingle Inſtance omitted by them all; I would fain know, whether in ſuch a Caſe that ſingle Inſtance might not reaſonably be deemed ſuſpitious, and of doubtfull Credit. But yet this is not the Caſe: For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Character of the Hiſtorians, even in point of Religion, very well ſuits with the Matter of their Hiſtory. Here we have <hi>five Heathen</hi> Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans writing the Life of a <hi>Heathen</hi> Prince; and therefore there can be no Exception taken to their Religion in that point: And if this was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, 'tis againſt the Authority of <hi>Joſephus;</hi> for I ſuppoſe the <hi>Heathens</hi> hated the <hi>Jews</hi> no more than the <hi>Jews</hi> did the <hi>Heathens;</hi> and I hope the Authority of a <hi>Heathen Hiſtorian</hi> may be argumentative with reſpect to the Hiſtory of a <hi>Heathen</hi> Prince, though it be not the ſame with reſpect to the Hiſtory of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. For what if they did bear Malice to the Jews, and to the Chriſtians, Did they bear Malice to <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo, that they would not tell the truth which they knew of him? Our Author indeed tells us, that <hi>it made for the Honour of the Jewiſh Nation;</hi> and what if it did? Did it not make for the Honour of <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who write the Story of <hi>Alexander,</hi> would not relate an <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and memorable Paſſage concerning him, becauſe that would redound alſo to the Honour of the <hi>Jews;</hi> that is to ſay, they would all of them doe wrong to Truth, to the Prince they wrote of, and to their own Hiſtory, rather than dee right to an Enemy. However the Queſtion is concerning the Hiſtory of an <hi>Heathen Prince,</hi> recorded by <hi>Heathen Hiſtorians,</hi> and I hope there is a great deal of Difference between Heathen Hiſtorians omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Matters relating to a Heathen Prince; and between Heathen Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40132:8"/>omitting Matters relating to our Saviour, and his Religion; for who expects an account of Chriſtianity from <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers? And 'tis a pure Conſequence, becauſe they have not recorded an extraordinary Inſtance in the Life of a <hi>Heathen,</hi> and becauſe likewiſe the <hi>Heathen Hiſtorians</hi> have not recorded the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> therefore their Omiſſion in one Caſe may be drawn into Argument, as well as the other: For our <hi>Author</hi> tells us very gravely,
<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> 
               <hi>We ought to take heed of ſuch Arguments as an Adverſary may make uſe of againſt the Goſpel itſelf.</hi> And what I pray is this dangerous Argument? Why truly 'tis as plain as can be; Becauſe one ſingle Story in the Life of a <hi>Heathen</hi> Prince is ſuſpitious, as being recorded onely by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> for that ſeveral <hi>Heathen</hi> Hiſtorians, of as good Credit as himſelf, who have given us the whole Progreſs of that Prince, have not in the leaſt mentioned it; therefore if this be admitted the Goſpel is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: For an Adverſary may ſay, that the <hi>Heathen Hiſtorians</hi> of thoſe times took no notice of the Miracles of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; and therefore if their Silence be an Argument of Suſpition, 'tis equally ſo in both Caſes, becauſe thoſe <hi>Heathen Hiſtorians</hi> neither undertook to write the Life of Chriſt, nor of his Apoſtles; nor, if they had, were they of equal Credit with them that did; nor is humane Teſtimony to ſtand in competition with divine Teſtimony. And now let any <hi>Heathen, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> Friend or Foe, provided he be a rational Creature, make ſuch an Argument, if he can; which notwithſtanding is the true ſtate of the Caſe. And by the way, if our Author had no more to ſay to prove the Authority of the Scriptures, than he has for the Authority of this Story of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> he would make the Scriptures themſelves as ſuſpitious as this Story: and he may conſider his own Caution; for as we ought to take heed of ſuch <hi>Arguments,</hi> ſo we ought to take heed of ſuch <hi>Parallels</hi> as an Adverſary may make uſe of againſt the Goſpel it ſelf. For as our Author hath handled the Matter, he makes the Authority of <hi>Joſephus</hi> equal with the Scriptures; for if the Silence of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Hiſtorians be no Argument againſt <hi>Joſephus,</hi> becauſe it is no Argument againſt the Scriptures, I doubt he muſt make both of the ſame Authority, or elſe own that his Anſwer is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But after all, our <hi>Author</hi> is not ſo apprehenſive of what an Adverſary in this Caſe may make uſe of againſt the Goſpel; for he tells us immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following, <hi>But if it were true that our Objector here ſays, that theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens tell us the clean contrary to that which we have from</hi> Joſephus, <hi>there might be ſomething in this Contradiction, though not in the Silence of Heathen Writers.</hi> Very well! Then ſuppoſe the Heathen Writers, as <hi>Porphirie</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> for Inſtance, ſhould expreſly ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did no Miracles, according to our Author's way of anſwering there might be <hi>ſomething</hi> in that, though nothing at all in their <hi>Silence,</hi> and then I doubt if an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary had the handling of it, he would go near to make a much ſtronger Argument againſt the Goſpel upon our Author's Principles, than if he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40132:8"/>from their meer Silence: But our Author's Buſineſs was to anſwer me, and that is enough at one time, and not to conſider the conſequences of his own Anſwers, which more palpably run him into thoſe very Inconveniences he is willing to charge me with; for if he will ſtick by his Anſwer, it inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably turns upon him, and he will never be able to avoid it: Well! but <hi>there might be ſomething in this Contradiction, though not in the Silence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers;</hi> But then what becomes of our Author's Reaſon before for their <hi>Silence; viz.</hi> their <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Jews?</hi> For if that be a Reaſon for their <hi>Silence</hi> of this Story, why is it not alſo as good a Reaſon for their <hi>Contradicting</hi> it? And if <hi>Malice</hi> prompted them to omit a Paſſage that made for the honour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, the ſame <hi>Malice,</hi> I ſuppoſe, might as well prompt them to ſay <hi>the clean contrary:</hi> For if Hiſtorians write by their Paſſions, and not according to plain Truth, that Character equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extends to what they ſay, as to what they do not, provided there be but the ſame Reaſon, that is, <hi>Malice</hi> to the Perſons about whom they write. So that had our Author ſo pleaſed, this might have been as good a Reaſon againſt their <hi>Contradicting</hi> this Story, as their <hi>Silence</hi> in it; and he might with the ſame Truth and Juſtice have charged them with <hi>malitious Inventing,</hi> as well as with <hi>malitious Omitting.</hi> But the Author I ſuppoſe did not think it neceſſary for his purpoſe now, he thought they did not contradict this Story, and therefore (though his Reaſon be the ſame againſt both) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to <hi>allow that there may be ſomething in this Contradiction.</hi> Well; let us take what he will allow us, and I believe he had better have kept to his Reaſon, and have charged them with <hi>Malice</hi> in all Points, and there had been an end, and there is no Credit to be given to what they ſay; and this, though no body could have believed it, it would have ſerved however for an Anſwer: For if our Author will admit their <hi>contradicting</hi> this Story to be <hi>ſomething,</hi> I doubt they have ſaid that which is very near contradicting it; and our Author muſt have an extraordinary Faculty, if he can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile this <hi>Story</hi> to what they deliver, as we ſhall ſee upon examining what our Author ſays. He adds, <hi>Perhaps the Objector might mean, that the account of thoſe Hiſtorians is contrary to that of the Author, againſt whom he writes; for this Author, as he cites him, (I know not how truly,) ſaith, that from</hi> Tyre Alexander <hi>came directly to</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>That indeed doth not agree with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given us by the Hiſtorians he mentions: But</hi> Joſephus <hi>doth not ſay this; he tells us that</hi> Alexander <hi>having beſieged</hi> Tyre <hi>ſeven Months, and then taken it, came forward to</hi> Gaza, <hi>and took it after a Siege of two Months, and then haſted to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſubmitted to him, as alſo did the neighbouring Cities.</hi> Now our Author ſeems to inſinuate to his Readers, that my Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was this: That whereas it is in the Objection, that <hi>Alexander</hi> from <hi>Tyre</hi> came directly to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I aſſert from the Hiſtorians, that he came from <hi>Tyre</hi> directly to <hi>Gaza,</hi> and not to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but this is neither my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, nor can be made out from my Words. I cited the Objection indeed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40132:9"/>as I found it, (whether our Author thinks I cited it truly or no,) and he that made the Objection put it in that manner; but I knew well enough <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> did not ſay, that <hi>Alexander</hi> came directly from <hi>Tyre</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore I took no advantage of that Miſtake, but ſuited my Anſwer to the Objection in the full latitude, and as it ought to have been; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I ſay that theſe Hiſtorians tell us,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 6.</note>
               <q>That from the Siege of <hi>Tyre Alexander</hi> went directly to <hi>Gaza,</hi> and ſo on into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </q> Now <hi>Alexander</hi>'s going directly from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> as much contradicts the true Objection, and the account of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as his going directly from <hi>Tyre</hi> to <hi>Gaza</hi> does the Miſtake of the Objector. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith our Author, <hi>this conſiſts very well with what we read in thoſe Hiſtorians; for they agree, that from</hi> Tyre <hi>he went directly to</hi> Gaza; <hi>yet after the taking that City, they do not ſay that he went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into</hi> Aegypt. <hi>He might ſtay long enough to go to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which was about fifty Miles diſtant, and receive the Submiſſion of that, and the neighbouring Cities, before he went into</hi> Aegypt. Now I do not know what our Author means, when he ſays theſe Hiſtorians do not ſay that <hi>Alexander</hi> went <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> They ſay he went from <hi>Gaza,</hi> and after the Siege of <hi>Gaza</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that, I think, is not ſaying, that from <hi>Gaza,</hi> or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Siege of <hi>Gaza,</hi> he went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the contrary; as if a Man deſcribing the Journies of a Traveller ſhould ſay, he came to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> and from thence he went to <hi>London,</hi> and then he went to <hi>Canterbury:</hi> I would fain ask any Body, whether this is not a contradiction to the ſaying that Traveller went from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>St. Albans,</hi> and thence to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> except the Man had ſome <hi>Spight</hi> to <hi>St. Albans,</hi> and then indeed I do not know how much it might alter the Buſineſs? The Situation is juſt the ſame; for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſtands North of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> is South: and a Man would be apt to imagine, that the ſaying <hi>Alexander</hi> went <hi>South,</hi> is a contradiction to the ſaying he went <hi>North;</hi> for as I take it, two oppoſite Points of the Compaſs are contrary to each other. And as to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s doing this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,</hi>

Now I doubt this does directly contradict the account of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> and which our Author defends: For if <hi>Alexander</hi> on the ſeventh day after his Removal from <hi>Gaza</hi> arrived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how it was poſſible for him to go with his whole Army fifty Miles ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, (for our Author tells us, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was about fifty Miles from <hi>Gaza,</hi>) and to receive the Submiſſion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſtay there a day at leaſt, and then purſue his Voyage into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and accompliſh all this in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days. I wonder what kind of Marches our Author, to make this out, muſt allot for great Armies? Archbiſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> (to whoſe Judgment our Author tells us he attributes much in theſe Matters,)
<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> was ſenſible of this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40132:9"/>Inconvenience; and therefore though he hath taken the main Story from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> yet he was not ſo very fond of his Credit, as to defend Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to juſtifie it; but plainly tells us from theſe Hiſtorians, that <hi>Alexander</hi> went directly from <hi>Gaza</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and came on the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> to <hi>Peluſium,</hi> and <hi>not,

Now it is plain. Bp. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> thought the account of theſe Hiſtorians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the account of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this matter; it is plain likewiſe, that for that Reaſon he rejected the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſo far as it relates to this particular; for he expreſly quotes <hi>Curtius</hi> and <hi>Arrian,</hi> and charges <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> with <hi>Inconſiderateneſs,</hi> for affirming contrary to what they do: And this is as good an Argument againſt the whole Story, as it is againſt this particular Branch of it; for if it be an Argument againſt <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s coming from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe theſe Hiſtorians ſay that on the ſeventh day upon his moving from <hi>Gaza,</hi> he came into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and this is irreconcilable with what <hi>Joſephus</hi> delivers. Then 'tis likewiſe an argument againſt his coming from <hi>Tyre</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which is the Bp's account;) for they as expreſly affirm that <hi>Alexander</hi> went directly from <hi>Tyre</hi> to <hi>Gaza,</hi> as that he went from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſeven days; and which our Author alſo owns. So that if the Reaſon be good, <hi>Alexander</hi> came not from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account, nor from <hi>Tyre</hi> to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as in the Biſhop's account; and conſequently he did not come there at all: So that although the Primate allows the Story, yet the reaſon why he rejects this part, is equally valid againſt the whole; and that is, as it contradicts the account given us by thoſe Hiſtorians who wrote the Life of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> upon the ſame Reaſon might be charged with <hi>Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Inconſiderateneſs,</hi> with reſpect to the whole, as well as with reſpect to a particular part of it; and his Authority againſt them is no better in one caſe, than it is in the other. And this I thought good to ſay with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Bp. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s account of this Matter, and I did it for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew our <hi>Author,</hi> that notwithſtanding his pretence of <hi>attributing very much to his Judgment in theſe Matters,</hi> he takes the liberty to differ from him, as often as he pleaſes, and as often as he thinks it for his purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew him that Bp. <hi>

<note place="margin">P. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew our <hi>Author</hi> the ingenuity of his inſinuating Parentheſis, p. 3. when he ſays concerning the Objection I put, with reſpect to this Story, that <hi>Alexander</hi> from <hi>Tyre</hi> came directly to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and then tells me, This Author, as he cites him, <hi>(I know not how truly;)</hi> Now (as it happens) the Objection is the very ſenſe of Bp. <hi>

            <p n="4">4 To ſhew our Author the great Difference that is between Archbiſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and him. The Archbiſhop indeed was a very learned Man, and, as our Author ſays,
<note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 
               <hi>a great Chronologer, and a good Textuary;</hi> and agreeable to that Character we do not find him loading thoſe Hiſtorians with Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Calumnies, and charging them with Hatred and Malice, when there is nothing elſe to ſay, which is a way of anſwering peculiar to our Author, and not much in uſe among learned Men. But inſtead of that the A. Bp. owns them as Authors of good Credit and Authority, and to ſay no more, in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Progreſs prefers them to <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and where they contradict the account of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> he owns theirs, and rejects <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s, as in the preſent Inſtance; and I doubt not but he would have rejected the whole Story, had he as well conſidered it; for the Reaſon is the ſame in both: But this Controverſie was never on foot before, and learned Men might eaſily let a Story paſs, which they had no great occaſion to conſider.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That it was the A. Bp's Judgment, (and, as our Author tells me, with reſpect to the Convocation,
<note place="margin">P. 20.</note> he may be <hi>aware how much the Archbiſhop's Judgment would be preferred before his, where he differs from him,</hi>) that the Story, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath laid it, contradicts the account of theſe Hiſtorians, and that the A. Bp. could not reconcile them; and therefore in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rejected the Authority of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> But however our Author makes it as eaſie as poſſible; for he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Alexander <hi>might well doe this,</hi> (go from <hi>Gaza</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,) according to</hi> Diodor<hi>'s account, who ſaith, that</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſettled things about <hi>Gaza,

                     </gap>.</note> he ſent away</hi> Amyntas <hi>into</hi> Macedonia. A very pleaſant account! <hi>Diodor</hi> ſaith <hi>Alexander ſettled</hi> or diſpoſed Things about <hi>Gaza;</hi> that is, according to our Author's Interpretation, he went and took in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the whole Kingdom of <hi>Judaea:</hi> Juſt as if a Man ſhould ſay, the King of <hi>England</hi> ſettled Things about <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> that is to ſay, he went and conquered <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and all the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> At this rate our Author may make Hiſtorians agree with him when he pleaſe, and they muſt be very <hi>malitious Heathens</hi> indeed, if he cannot bring them over to ſerve his purpoſe. And yet after ſuch Proofs as theſe our Author gravely concludes, <hi>This being not contrary, but very conſiſtent with the account we have from</hi> Joſephus, <hi>there is no farther cauſe of</hi> Suſpition <hi>on this Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing which our Authour examines, is the <hi>Difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling it to Chronology.</hi> Nay, (our Author adds,) <hi>This is not all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector

            <p>And with reſpect to the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that attend this Story in point of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,</hi> firſt of all our Author asks, <hi>Where are they;
<note place="margin">P. 4.</note> for I confeſs I do not ſee any Difficulty?</hi> Now had Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> been to anſwer, he would have told him, <hi>They are in my Book ſtill, and there he may find them:</hi> And I muſt needs <hi>confeſs,</hi> this is quick and expeditious, and if <hi>Difficulties</hi> will be anſwered by asking where they are, we may expect full Performance. But ſuppoſe our Author cannot ſee Wood for Trees; he cannot ſee the <hi>Difficulties,</hi> becauſe ſo thick and obvious; he cannot ſee them becauſe he can ſee nothing elſe. The Chronology of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> affairs, that are contemporary with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, is a difficult piece of Chronology, as any other whatever, and hath been matter of Diſpute and Contention among all Chronologers; and one main Reaſon of that is, The lame and imperfect (not to ſay falſe) account that <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath given of the affairs of <hi>Judaea,</hi> with reſpect to that time; and this very Story (whether our Author can ſee it or no) hath been one ground of theſe Contentions: However the <hi>Difficulties</hi> may be what they will, for any thing our Author ſays to remove or reconcile them. He hath given another account indeed of ſome things than I have done;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40132:11"/>and who could doubt of that? Other Men have given another account than he has done; and as many Men as have undertaken it, there are ſo many Minds about it, our Author's own account in ſome reſpects differs from all the World beſides, as we ſhall ſee by and by; but this makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt my Objection, but for it; for I plainly ſuppoſe it, and my Argument turns upon it, and the conſequence is, that therefore it is <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</hi> The various account that is given proves the Uncertainty, and if the Author's account differs from others as good Chronologers as himſelf, this ſtill farther confirms it, whether our Author can ſee any Difficulty or no. The force of this will appear as we proceed.</p>
            <p>The Author ſays I tell him the Difficulty <hi>lies in the Ages of the Perſons, mighty Ages, not in the leaſt mentioned by any Hiſtorian, as that</hi> Sanballat <hi>lived to above</hi> 145, <hi>and</hi> Jaddus <hi>to above</hi> 124 <hi>Years of age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwers, <hi>But doth</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſay this? Not in words, nothing like it.</hi> Right, nor in ſenſe neither; and ſo I had ſaid, as plain as I could ſpeak, —
<q>That neither <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 9.</note> nor any other Hiſtorian, takes the leaſt notice of either of them living to ſuch mighty ages;</q> — and our Author repeats it, <hi>not in the leaſt mentioned by any Hiſtorian.</hi> And this is plainly the reaſon of my Objection, That becauſe neither <hi>Joſephus,</hi> nor any Hiſtorian had taken notice of their living to ſuch ages, therefore there was no reaſon to conclude they lived ſo long; and this I had confirmed from Experience and common Obſervation, that ſuch Inſtances are as famous as Prodigies, and as much taken notice of by Hiſtorians, as in the Caſe of old <hi>Parr.</hi> And what then doth our Author mean by his Queſtion, <hi>Does</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſay this, or any thing like it?</hi> For if he had ſaid it, there would have been no force in that part of the Objection, and it is founded in his not ſaying it: But this is the effect of Jumbling and Confuſion, and of taking pieces of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, without conſidering the whole Argument; Men ſpeak for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries when they think they ſpeak againſt them. And our <hi>Author</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwering hath confirmed and proved my Objection; and he gives that very thing in anſwer, which in ſo many words I had given as the Ground of my Objection. <hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it muſt come to this, if the Objector reckons true.</hi> Come to what? <hi>That</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſays</hi> Sanballat <hi>lived to above</hi> 145 <hi>Years,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing like it: It muſt come to this indeed, that <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> is miſtaken in his Calculation of the Time wherein <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> lived: But this is nothing at all to his <hi>ſaying</hi> they lived ſo long; for that he does not ſay; and yet aſſigning them to ſuch times, when by Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Computation they muſt have lived to ſuch ages, and in the mean time taking no notice that they actually did live to ſuch remarkable ages, is a ſign that he hath miſplaced them, and is out as to the time of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, though he might not be ſo in their reſpective ages, which he takes no notice of. He adds, <hi>and if he miſreckon for</hi> Joſephus, <hi>he deals as ill with Scripture, onely he doth not charge it with Suſpition on that account.</hi> This is a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40132:11"/>very ſad buſineſs indeed; that is to ſay, I do not think the Scripture account is <hi>ſuſpitious,</hi> though I think <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account is; and where is the harm of that? and where, I wonder is the <hi>ill dealing with Scripture?</hi> why 'tis as plain as can be; for he adds, <hi>But according to the Scripture, as he underſtands it,</hi> Ezra <hi>muſt have lived to a much greater age than either of theſe before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</hi> But now for the Validity of our Author's Anſwer; <hi>Did I ſay this? Not in words; nothing like it.</hi> No matter for that; our Author hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to doe, than to mind whether his own Anſwers anſwer himſelf: However he tells us, That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Objector will have</hi> Ezra <hi>born about ſix years before the</hi> Babylonian <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and to have ſeen the firſt Temple ſtanding, and fifty nine years after this,</hi> viz.
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>in the firſt year of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>to have returned from the Captivity; ſo that then</hi> Ezra <hi>was</hi> 65 <hi>years of age by his Reckoning: From thence to the ſeventh of</hi> Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes Longimanus, <hi>are</hi> 79 <hi>years; ſo that then</hi> Ezra <hi>muſt have been</hi> 144 <hi>years of age; and yet it is certain, that in that year</hi> Ezra <hi>made a Journey from</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>to</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>and as certain that he lived</hi> 13 <hi>years after that,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.</note> till the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> Artaxerxes; <hi>and then be muſt have been</hi> 157 <hi>years of age; and yet as old as he was, that very year he led the Proceſſion up and down Stairs, about,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Neh.</hi> 12.36, 37.</note> the Wall of</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>He might live many years after this, as we may judge by his ſtrength of Body in that Exerciſe; but if he dyed that year, being</hi> 159 <hi>years old, as he muſt be by the Objector's Reckoning,</hi> — And after having proved his point by theſe Chronological Steps, he thus concludes: <hi>He that finds no Difficulty in this, or takes no notice of it, for fear of reflecting upon Scripture, ought not to call that Story in</hi> Joſephus ſuſpitious, <hi>becauſe of the</hi> Difficulty of reconciling it with <hi>Chronology.</hi> And why ſo, I pray? Is the Authority of <hi>Joſephus</hi> as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred as the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> and is there the ſame reaſon to charge the Scripture account with Suſpicion, becauſe of ſome Chronological Difficulties, as there is a <hi>Story</hi> in <hi>Joſephus?</hi> And here I muſt once again congratulate our <hi>Author,</hi> that he did not write againſt Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> for then he might have been told, <hi>Whither theſe Arguments will carry our Author I cannot tell.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vindicat. p.</hi> 48, 49.</note> I grant indeed,</hi> that a Story in <hi>Joſephus</hi> is ſuſpitious, becauſe it is clogg'd with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; <hi>but is that a Reaſon to reject the</hi> Authority <hi>of Scripture too? This hath nothing but either Scepticiſm or Infallibility at the bottom.</hi> And this though it was nothing againſt his Anſwerer, I am affraid it will reach home here; for if to argue from the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that are in the Scriptures, to the <hi>Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> of the Truth of what they deliver in thoſe Matters, be as reaſonable as to argue in the ſame manner with reſpect to humane Writings, then I doubt it will follow, (as the Doctor ſays,) <hi>that we muſt be either Scepticks in Religion, or ſeek for an infallible Interpreter:</hi> If it be not as reaſonable, then our Author's Concluſion is nothing to the Purpoſe, and his Premiſſes and Concluſion do not agree. His Premiſſes are, that according to the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's account of Scripture, <hi>Ezra</hi> muſt have lived to 157 years; and this is a Difficulty in Chronology: And thence concludes, that <hi>I ought not to call
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40132:12"/>that Story in</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſuſpitious, becauſe of the Difficulty of reconciling it with Chronology,</hi> as if the Difficulty of reconciling a Story with Chronology, was as good an Argument againſt the Authority of Scripture, as it is againſt the Authority of <hi>Joſephus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> Our Author tells me, that <hi>an eager deſire to find Faults in</hi> Joſephus <hi>blinded my Eyes:</hi> Now Paſſion, Intereſt, and the God of this World is very apt to doe ſo, and if our Author pleaſe to conſider, whether an eager Deſire to <hi>vindicate</hi> him, hath not had that very effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
            <p>Our Authour adds,
<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> 
               <hi>In vain do Men talk of reconciling Differences,</hi> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould be Difficulties,) <hi>where there are none, but of their own making. They that take</hi> Ezra <hi>to have been born before the Captivity, judge ſo for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Now here are two things of pleaſant Obſervation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But juſt before our Author tells me, that <hi>I find no Difficulty in the Age of</hi> Ezra, and objects it to me, and argues upon it, and yet now it muſt be, <hi>in vain do Men talk of</hi> Difficulties, though all the <hi>Difficulties</hi> he ſpeaks of here are ſuch only as reſpect the age of <hi>Ezra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He intimates, that theſe Difficulties are onely of my <hi>own making;</hi> and yet it immediately follows, They <hi>that take</hi> Ezra <hi>to have been born,</hi> &amp;c. then it ſeems it is <hi>They,</hi> and not my ſelf onely, that have made it, or found it, which our Author pleaſe. And what can a Man ſay to ſuch an Anſwerer, that forgets himſelf at this rate, and twice together contradicts in the Line following what he had ſaid but the very Line before.</p>
            <p>Well, but <hi>They that take</hi> Ezra <hi>to have been born before the Captivity, judge ſo for this Reaſon,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.1.</note> becauſe it is ſaid, that he was the Son of</hi> Seraia <hi>the high Prieſt, that was killed before the Captivity: But in like manner</hi> Seraiah <hi>is there made the</hi> 17th <hi>from</hi> Aaron, <hi>that lived near a thouſand years before. The meaning is, that</hi> Seraia <hi>was deſcended from</hi> Aaron (<hi>and ſo</hi> Ezra <hi>was from</hi> Seraia) <hi>not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but with others between, that are not mentioned. And ſo</hi> Johanan <hi>the High Prieſt is called the Son of</hi> Eliaſhib,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Neb.</hi> 12.23.12.10.</note> 
               <hi>who indeed was his Grandfather, and his Father was</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>that is not there mentioned. This is a common way of ſhortening Pedigrees, which if the Objector had conſidered, he would not have run himſelf into that Difficulty of</hi> Ezra<hi>'s Age, which though he takes no notice of, is much greater than thoſe of which he complains.</hi> In anſwer to this I have theſe things to obſerve:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Author's Solution of this Difficulty is not very probable: For though it be admitted, that Pedigrees in Scripture are often ſhortened; and according to the way of Expreſſion among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when one is ſaid to be the Son of another, it does not always mean, that that Perſon was his immediate Father, but that he was deſcended from him, though not immediately. But this notwithſtanding, here are two things that make a great difference in the preſent Caſe, and which are reaſons that it is not ſo to be underſtood, when it is ſaid that <hi>Ezra</hi> was the Son of <hi>Seraia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40132:12"/> (1.) That <hi>Ezra</hi> himſelf was the Perſon who related this Pedigree,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezra</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.1.</note> and it is not very probable that he ſhould omit and make no mention of his own immediate Father; and I believe there is not one ſingle Inſtance to be found, in the deſcribing any Genealogy in Scripture, that the immediate Father of the Perſon whoſe Genealogy was deſcribed was left out, though at the ſame time ſome others of the direct Line, but of remoter diſtance, have been omitted; and this is yet more, when the Perſon writes his own Genealogy: And therefore the Inſtance the Author mentions is not paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, that <hi>Johanan</hi> is called the Son of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> who was his Grandfather;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 12.23.</note> for there it is onely barely mentioned, as denoting the Man. But the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of <hi>Johanan</hi> is not there recited, and much leſs recited by himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Where there are ſuch Omiſſions, they are prov'd to be ſo from other places of Scripture; but when there are no ſuch Proofs, they are preſumed to be the immediate Sons of the Perſons whoſe Sons they are named to be; In the Author's Inſtance <hi>Johanan</hi> is called the Son of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> and he would have been ſo reputed, had it not appeared in other places that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> was his Father, and not <hi>Eliaſhib.</hi> But who was the Father of <hi>Ezra,</hi> if <hi>Seraia</hi> was not? He is ſaid to be ſo, and it does not appear that any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was; and it is purely arbitrary to ſay he was not, without any other proof but the <hi>Commonneſs of ſhortening Pedigrees:</hi> For as common as that was, a great many, nay moſt were immediately deſcended from thoſe Perſons who are ſaid to be their Fathers. And it is not reaſonable to make this Exception general, and to affirm it of any Perſon of our own Heads, and where there is nothing in Scripture to make it appear. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe all this and what then? Why then I am miſtaken in the time that I have aſſigned to the Birth of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and that (as I underſtand it) is a Difficulty in Chronology greater than thoſe I complain of, and I take no notice of it. Suppoſe I am miſtaken in the time of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s living, does it follow therefore that <hi>Joſephus</hi> is not miſtaken as to the Times of <hi>Jaddus?</hi> That Conſequence I ſuppoſe lies a great way off, and that is the main Controverſie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe again that I am miſtaken, as to the time of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Birth; what is that to the Argument upon the account of which I mentioned it? which was to prove, that the building the ſecond Temple was in the time of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> not of <hi>Darius Nothus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. p. 7, 8.</note> the force of which does not ſtand purely upon the time of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Birth, but of thoſe who ſaw the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in its Glory, and were living at the Building of the ſecond Temple,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.3.</note> and lamented at the great Difference that was between them: and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will anſwer that, muſt not onely prove that <hi>Ezra</hi> was not the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Son of <hi>Seraia,</hi> according to the manner of ſhortening Genealogies, but muſt prove alſo, that none of thoſe who ſaw the firſt Temple, were alive at the Building the ſecond. But our Author does not meddle with that, nor at all concern himſelf with the reaſon for which it was uſed, and for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40132:13"/>which it was urged, not ſingly as a Proof by it ſelf, but jointly with other Inſtances, and which the other Inſtances without this are a ſufficient Proof of. But our Author is for picking out a ſingle Inſtance from the reſt, and diſputing about it, though the Argument does not conſiſt in it; and though it would be the ſame without it. But this we muſt expect from an Author who ſnatches one part of a Diſcourſe from another, and neither conſiders nor will repeat the main Argument, upon the account of which it was uſed; for then it would plainly have appeared how trifling his Exceptions were: for ſuppoſe all that he deſires were granted him, let <hi>Seraia</hi> be ſuppoſed not onely to be the Grandfather, but the great Grandfather of <hi>Ezra,</hi> (which may as well be ſuppoſed, according to our Author's Interpretation,) what does this ſignifie to my Argument, which does not purely depend upon <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s age, but is equally valid with and without it? But the Caſe is quite otherwiſe in the preſent Controverſie; for if <hi>Joſephus</hi> be miſtaken in the time of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> our Author's Argument, and all that is built upon it, falls to the ground. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why did not our Author, who writes a Letter in <hi>Vindication of</hi> Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> take <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account of this Matter? Now <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ezra</hi> went from <hi>Babylon</hi> in the time of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> and not in the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Succeſſor, and that in his Reign all thoſe Facts of <hi>Ezra</hi> were done, which our Author mentions: But there was good reaſon for this; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He muſt have aſſigned a far leſs age to <hi>Ezra</hi> than he hath done, by about 40 years, and then there would have been no great reaſon to ſolve the Difficulty by the <hi>Commonneſs of ſhortening Pedigrees.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This would have ſhewn how wofully <hi>Joſephus</hi> had been out in his <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,</hi> even in our Author's own Computation; and then it would have looked very pleaſantly for our <hi>Author</hi> to call his Book, <hi>A Letter in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Joſephus, and yet in the ſame Book to have palpably contradicted it himſelf. But our Author likes <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account very well, when it makes for him; but when it does not, he is as free to contradict him, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer himſelf: And therefore I think the Author hath miſtaken his Title; for inſtead of <hi>Vindication,</hi> he might have ſaid, <hi>A Letter in</hi> Contradiction <hi>to</hi> Jeſephus; for he himſelf contradicts <hi>Joſephus</hi> as much as I do, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the ſame in both; and I would fain ſee a Reaſon why <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is more valid as to the times of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> than it is as to the times of <hi>Ezra:</hi> For my part, I know no difference, except it be one, that one is ſerviceable to our Author's Purpoſe, but not the other. But our <hi>Author</hi> hath made a far greater breach in the account of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as we ſhall ſee immediately.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>Thoſe that he complains of are Difficulties of his own making, and proceed onely from an eager deſire to find Faults in that Story of</hi> Joſephus. <hi>If this had not blinded his Eyes, he might have ſeen, that admitting that Story to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40132:13"/>true, yet there was no neceſſity either of making</hi> Jaddus <hi>or</hi> Sanballat <hi>live to ſo great an Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, for</hi> Jaddus, <hi>who (as he ſaith) muſt have been</hi> 124 <hi>Years old at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of</hi> Tyre, <hi>the Objector proves his Age by theſe ſteps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He takes it for granted, that</hi> Jaddus <hi>was High Prieſt at the time the Book of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>was written; but he takes this onely as probable; and therefore by his own Confeſſion, all can be but probable that he builds on it.</hi> Now as he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this, our Author would perſuade his Reader, that I am as forgetfull as he is; and that in one page I took that for <hi>granted</hi> as a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth, which in the next page I take onely as <hi>probable;</hi> whereas there is no ſuch difference in what I deliver. I ſay indeed,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 6.</note>
               <q>That <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> (ch. 13. v. 21.) intimates <hi>Jaddus</hi> his then being High Prieſt;—</q> But I think, ſaying <hi>Nehemiah intimates,</hi> is not ſaying I take it for granted; but that it ſeems to be implied, or denoted, by what <hi>Nehemiah</hi> there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>i.e.</hi> 'tis <hi>probable Nehemiah</hi>'s words were ſo to be underſtood: But I did not peremptorily affirm, and take it for granted that he did ſo; and accordingly I ſay afterwards, (page 7.) that 'tis <hi>probable Jaddus</hi> was then High Prieſt: And therefore our Author is in the right, when he ſays, <hi>by his own Confeſſion all can be but probable that he builds upon it;</hi> for I do confeſs it, and deſire to <hi>build</hi> no more <hi>on it,</hi> that being ſufficient for my purpoſe: And if our Author's Account was but probable likewiſe, it will ſerve my purpoſe as well as my own; for I hope bare <hi>Probabilities</hi> are not ſufficient for to make Examples and Preſidents in Matters of the higheſt Importance. But which of the two is moſt <hi>probable,</hi> we ſhall ſee upon examining what our Author offers in oppoſition.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>Next for the time when that Book was written; it muſt have been before</hi> Nehemiah <hi>dyed, that is certain. But when did he dye? The Objector tells us from</hi> Briet, <hi>that he dyed the laſt Year of</hi> Longimanus, <hi>who reigned forty one Years. But to what end doth he tell us this; for he himſelf could not believe it?</hi> And I pray mark his Reaſon, it follows; <hi>as appears by his Words; for (ſays he) I think the leaſt we can allow for the time of</hi> Nehemiah<hi>'s living after he ended his Book, is thirty Years, and it is very probable it was much more.</hi> Theſe indeed I own to be my own Words; but as the <hi>Author</hi> hath placed them, the ſenſe is mine no more than black and white are one colour. The whole Sentence is this:
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 7.</note>
               <q>I think the leaſt we can allow for the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s living after he ended his Book, and for the marriageble Age of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and then for <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Age, as elder than him, the leaſt we can allow is thirty Years, and it is very probable it was much more.—</q> And now does not any Man ſee the Fairneſs and Ingenuity of our Author's Anſwers, and how purely he proves, that <hi>according to my words, Nehemiah</hi> lived thirty years after he ended his Book; whereas all that I allow is, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lived ſome time after he ended his Book, (and which I ſuppoſe our Author will not deny;) but for the thirty years, they plainly refer to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40132:14"/>the age of <hi>Jaddus;</hi> and which is prov'd by a complicancy of Circumſtances, as the time <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lived after he ended his Book, the marriageable age of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> (who was then actually married,) and the age of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> as elder than he; from all theſe together it is reaſonable to conclude, <hi>Jaddus</hi> was then thirty years old at leaſt, and probably much more, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he was at leaſt of that age, according to this Calculation, the laſt year of <hi>Longimanus.</hi> But nothing at all of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s living thirty years after he ended his Book, which I never thought of; and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any Man but our Author, to conclude ſo: But who can expect otherwiſe from an Author who pulls Sentences to pieces, and joins the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end together, and leaves out the middle, and then draws In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and Proofs from it, as if it had been the ſenſe of the Perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he diſputes; at this rate he may make me ſay and <hi>confeſs</hi> what he pleaſes: And which is yet more pleaſant, he applies this very Sentence to the age of <hi>Jaddus,
<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> and then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the age of</hi> Jaddus, <hi>which our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector ſaith, the leaſt we can allow is thirty years, and it is very probable it was much more.</hi> But then how comes this to be applied to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and to prove, (as our Author undertakes to much purpoſe,) that then <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote nine <hi>years before any of thoſe things happened which are written in his Book.</hi> But when Men diſpute in this manner, and take one piece of a Sentence, and argue againſt it in one place, and take another piece of the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and argue againſt it in another, and draw Concluſions from a part, which ought to be drawn from the whole; it is no great Wonder, that as they miſrepreſent their Adverſaries, ſo they contradict themſelves. And after ſuch a curious ſtrain of anſwering, our Author thus gravely concludes, <hi>Now this I think our Author could not mean, (i. e.)</hi> that the Book of <hi>Nehemiah was written nine years before the things happened that were written in it,</hi> (and he may be ſure of it,) <hi>and therefore he doth but amuſe us with that idle Quotation.</hi> Now indeed the Quotation out of <hi>Briet</hi> was mine, but the Reaſon is the Author's, and if that be <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>amuſing,</hi> it is no bodie, but his own.</p>
            <p>But why, I pray, is a Quotation out of <hi>Briet idle?</hi> Is he an Author ſo very trifling, that it is a Reproach to quote any thing out of him? But our Author hath the moſt expeditious Method of clearing his hands of Authors that are not for him, that ever I met with; <hi>Diodorus, Plutarch,</hi> and the reſt, are a company of <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>malitious,</hi> and there is an Anſwer for them; to quote out of <hi>Briet</hi> is <hi>idle,</hi> and there is an end of that: And if Authors will not be turned off in this manner, they are importunate and troubleſome; for our Authour is not at leiſure to give them any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>Howſoever, as if he had proved ſomething by this, he infers from it, (I know not how,) that</hi> Jaddus <hi>was High Prieſt the laſt Year of</hi> Artaxerxes. Now I thought I had expreſſed it plain enough,
<note place="margin">Ch. 12. ver. 22.</note> but to gratifie him, I will tell him once again how I infer it. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in his Book intimates <hi>Jaddus</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:40132:14"/>being High Prieſt, <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> according to <hi>Briet,</hi> dyed the laſt year of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> and his Book was written ſome time before he dyed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to <hi>Briet</hi>'s Account, <hi>Jaddus</hi> muſt have been High Prieſt at leaſt the laſt year of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and whether our Author knows it or no, this Inference was plain enough before; and it is impoſſible for any Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our Author to make any other: But this is <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>amuſing;</hi> and therefore our Author tells us again, <hi>Though I do not ſee which way he proves this, I ſee very clear Reaſons to the contrary, which I think are unanſwerable.</hi> Now I wiſh I could ſee them too; for I confeſs, that <hi>unanſwerable Reaſons</hi> are certainly <hi>Reaſons.</hi> But I doubt he hath turned the Proſpective, and looks upon his own Reaſons with the magnifying end, as he did mine with the other; for that his Reaſons (as he calls them) are no clear Reaſons at all, much leſs unanſwerable ones, will appear upon conſidering them; they are theſe: 1. <hi>That the Book of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>was not written till after the death of</hi> Longimanus. 2. <hi>That</hi> Jaddus <hi>was not High Prieſt at the death of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes, <hi>nor probably born then, nor long after, till the end of</hi> Darius Nothus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That</hi> Nehemiah <hi>did not write in any part of</hi> Artaxerxes<hi>'s Reign, but either in or after the time of</hi> Darius, <hi>his immediate Succeſſor.</hi> But why this Disjunctive <hi>in</hi> or <hi>after,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> in great black letters too? And he ſays he <hi>inſiſts upon it, that it was</hi> after <hi>the Reign of</hi> Darius; and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him his Obſervation the page before, I ſuppoſe there is not more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in ſaving, (if I had ſaid it,) <hi>That I take it for granted, and yet I take it onely as probable,</hi> than there is in ſaying that it is <hi>in</hi> or <hi>after,</hi> and yet immediately to <hi>inſiſt</hi> upon it that it is <hi>after.</hi> Well: But our Authour does inſiſt upon it, that it was <hi>after.</hi> And how does he prove this? Why truly by a <hi>Hebrew</hi> Criticiſm, for he adds, <hi>ſo the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Words ſhew, that he writ when that Reign was expired, for there it is ſaid that the Heads of the</hi> Levites, <hi>and alſo the Prieſts,</hi> were recorded <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> over <hi>or</hi> throughout <hi>the Reign of</hi> Darius, <hi>it appears that the words are ſo to be underſtood, by what follows in the next verſe, where it is ſaid, that the Heads of the</hi> Levites <hi>were recorded in the Books of the</hi> Chronicles <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>throughout; i. e.</hi> from one end to the other: And I deſire our Author to ſhew me where it means ſo, either in Scripture, or is ſo interpreted by any Hebrew Lexicon; and I hope there is ſome difference between <hi>over</hi> a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and <hi>throughout</hi> a Reign.

And does our Author think that his little Criticiſm, and ſingular Interpretation is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bear down the Authority of all Interpreters?
<note place="margin">P. 22.</note> He tells me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and he may now take it to himſelf, <hi>He values his own Opinion too much, who would impoſe it on others at this rate.</hi> However,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If this was granted him, it will by no means ſerve his turn; for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Heads of the <hi>Levites,</hi> &amp;c. were recorded <hi>throughout</hi> the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> why then <hi>Jaddus</hi> muſt have been high Prieſt in the Reign of that <hi>Darius,</hi> which notwithſtanding is directly contrary to our Author's Chronology, who places his Grandfather <hi>Joiada</hi> in that Reign, and <hi>Jaddus</hi> himſelf 68 years after, in the Reign of <hi>Ochus;</hi> for thus it is in <hi>Nehemiah:
<note place="margin">Ch. 12. ver. 23.</note> The Levites in the days of</hi> Eliaſhib, Joiada, <hi>and</hi> Johanan, <hi>and</hi> Jaddua, <hi>were recorded chief of the Fathers; alſo the Prieſts, to the Reign of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>the</hi> Perſian. Now ſuppoſe <hi>to</hi> the Reign, meant <hi>throughout</hi> the Reign, then <hi>Jaddas</hi> muſt have been High Prieſt in the Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> for otherwiſe the <hi>Levites</hi> could not be recorded in <hi>his</hi> days, <hi>throughout</hi> that Reign. But this will ſerve our Author's turn as little as if <hi>Jaddus</hi> had been High Prieſt in the Reign of his Predeceſſor, <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and ſo he might be too, though his Criticiſm was allowed him: But for that</p>
            <p>Our Author tells us, <hi>I take</hi> Nehemiah's <hi>meaning in two verſes to be thus in ſhort:
<note place="margin">Ver. 22, 23. Neh. 12.1.7. V. 12, 21. V. 8, 9, &amp; 24, 25, 26.</note> Having given Account of the Heads of the Prieſts that were in time of</hi> Jeſhua, <hi>the High Prieſt; and afterwards of them that were in the time of his Son</hi> Joiakim: <hi>Having alſo given Account of the Heads of the</hi> Levites <hi>that were in</hi> Joiakim's <hi>time, he thought ſome Account would be expected of them that were in the days of the following High Prieſts.</hi> Very well! He had given account of the Heads of the Prieſts in <hi>Jeſhua</hi>'s time, and he had given account of the Heads of the Prieſts and Levites in his Son <hi>Joiakim</hi>'s time, and he thought ſome account might be expected of them that were in the days of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing High Prieſts; but I hope no body expected that he ſhould give an account of more than he knew, or of more than was in his own time; or, if they did, I ſuppoſe he neither could nor would offer to doe it, to humor any Man's Expectation; except he did it by the <hi>Spirit of Propheſie,</hi> which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40132:15"/>our Authour tells us in the Caſe of <hi>Darius,</hi> he <hi>thinks no Man will ſay.</hi> He immediately adds, <hi>And therefore he inſerted theſe two Verſes; i. e.</hi> He inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe two Verſes to give an account of the Heads of the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, that were in the days of the following High Prieſts; that is, of the following High Prieſts that were in own his time; for 'tis ridiculous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him account of the heads of the Prieſts and Levites that were in the times of High Prieſts who were after his time: But then it follows, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> was High Prieſt in the days of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and before he ended his Book; for the Words are theſe: <hi>The Levites in the days of</hi> Eliaſhib,
<note place="margin">Ch. 12. ver. 22.</note> Joiada, <hi>and</hi> Johanan, <hi>and</hi> Jaddua, <hi>were recorded chief of the Fathers, alſo the Prieſts to the Reign of</hi> Darius <hi>the Perſian.</hi> And what account, I pray, is this, but an account of the Levites in the days of all thoſe High Prieſts,even in the days of <hi>Jaddua,</hi> as well as of the reſt? But this, as plain as it is, our Author is not for, and therefore tells us, <hi>that he inſerted theſe Verſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he tells us, That as for the Levites which were in the days of</hi> Eliaſhib, Joiada, Johanan, <hi>and</hi> Jaddua, <hi>the Heads of theſe</hi> Levites, <hi>and alſo the Prieſts, all that were in the Reign of</hi> Darius, <hi>were recorded in the Books of the</hi> Chronicles; <hi>but afterwards the Prieſts were not recorded, but onely the Heads of the Levites, and thoſe onely during the High Prieſthood of</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>and</hi> Joiada, <hi>who were then dead; but not of</hi> Johanan, <hi>who it ſeems was then newly come to be High Prieſt when this Book was written.</hi> Now here is ſuch an Interpretation of Scripture, that I deſie all the World to ſhew me the Fellow of it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Text ſaith, The Levites in the Days of <hi>Eliaſhib, Joiada,</hi> and <hi>Johanan,</hi> and <hi>Jaddua, were</hi> recorded: And our Author ſays, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites in the days of <hi>Johanan</hi> and <hi>Jaddua were not</hi> recorded, but onely in the days of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Joiada;</hi> that is, he expounds Scripture, by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right contradicting it, and in expreſs Terms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He tells us, that <hi>the Levites that were in the days of</hi> Eliaſhib, Joiada, Johanan, <hi>and</hi> Jaddua, <hi>the Heads of thoſe Levites, and alſo the Prieſts, all that were in the Reign of</hi> Darius Nothus, <hi>were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles: But afterwards, i. e.</hi> after the Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus, the Prieſts were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, but onely the Heads of the Levites, and thoſe onely during the High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>and</hi> Joiada, <hi>who were then dead.</hi> Now we are to take notice that our Author, page 8. and in his Scheme page 10. makes <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> High Prieſt at leaſt twenty years before the Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> and that he dyed in his <hi>Reign,</hi> and <hi>Joiada</hi> was High Prieſt ſome years before the death of that Prince. And does not our Author begin to ſee what woeful Work he hath made on't? That is to ſay, the Heads of the Levites, and alſo the Prieſts, in the days of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Joiada,</hi> were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles; but <hi>afterwards, i. e.</hi> in the days of the ſame <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Joiada,</hi> the Prieſts were not, but onely the Heads of the Levites were recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Chronicles. And that is to ſay again, That the Heads of the Levites, and alſo the Prieſts, <hi>were</hi> recorded in the Books of the Chronicles,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40132:16"/>during the whole Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> and that the Prieſts <hi>were not</hi> recorded, but onely the Heads of the Levites, during the <hi>ſame Reign,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame Book.</hi> And that is to ſay yet again, that the <hi>Heads of the Levites, and alſo the Prieſts,</hi> all that were in the Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> were recorded; but <hi>afterwards onely</hi> the Heads of the Levites, and <hi>not</hi> the Prieſts, during the High Prieſthood of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> which was twenty years <hi>before</hi> the Reign of the ſame <hi>Darius.</hi> And yet he tells us in this matter, that he <hi>thinks his Reaſons unanſwerable.</hi> Now I cannot tell what Opinion our Author may have of his own Reaſons; but heretofore Men did not uſe to take plain Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for unanſwerable Reaſons.
<note place="margin">ver. 22.</note> He adds, <hi>As for</hi> Jaddua, <hi>he is mentioned both here, and before in this Chapter, not as being High Prieſt then, (how could he in his Father's days?) but onely as being then living, and Heir apparent of the Prieſthood.</hi> And here we have another curious vein of Interpretation: For I wonder where our Author finds, either in Scripture, or any where elſe, that where any Things or Actions are dated in the <hi>Days</hi> of a Perſon of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Station, that it is not to be underſtood of the <hi>Days, i. e.</hi> during the time of his publick Station, but of the <hi>Days</hi> of his Life; as when it is ſaid in the <hi>Days</hi> of King <hi>Charles,</hi> it means the Days of his Reign and publick Adminiſtration, and not of his Life. But ſuppoſe it might mean other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; how comes the very ſame Expreſſion to ſignifie one thing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Jaddua,</hi> and another with reſpect to all the reſt mentioned in the ſame place? The words are, <hi>in the days</hi> of <hi>Eliaſhib, Joiada,</hi> and <hi>Johanan,</hi> and <hi>Jaddua;</hi> that is, according to our Author's Interpretation, in the days of the High Prieſthood of <hi>Eliaſhib, Joiada,</hi> and <hi>Johanan;</hi> but in the days of the Heir apparentſhip of <hi>Jaddua:</hi> Juſt as if a Man ſhould ſay, in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James, Charles</hi> the firſt and <hi>ſecond,</hi> he ſhould mean the actual Reigns of the three firſt; but the other onely as <hi>living, and Heir apparent to the Crown.</hi> And yet in this fine manner does our Author interpret Scripture; and <hi>Jaddua</hi> muſt be mentioned as next Heir, contrary both to all Rules of Interpretation, and even to common ſenſe. But in truth, as our Author has handled the matter, it is impoſſible to know what <hi>Jaddua</hi> was mentioned at all for, or <hi>Johanan</hi> either; for our Author tells us, that the ground and Reaſon of the adding theſe two Verſes by <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was, for that <hi>having given account of the Heads of the Prieſts in the times of</hi> Jeſhua <hi>and</hi> Joiakim, <hi>and of the Heads of the Levites, in</hi> Joiakim<hi>'s time, he thought ſome account would be expected of them that were in the days of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing High Prieſts.</hi> Very well; and to ſatisfie that Expectation <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> according to our Author, gives account of the Prieſts and Levites that were in the days of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Joiada,</hi> but not of <hi>Johanan</hi> nor <hi>Jaddua,</hi> who it ſeems was onely Heir apparent. But then what are <hi>Johanan</hi> and <hi>Jaddua</hi> mentioned for? Why truly for juſt nothing at all: For if the reaſon of inſerting theſe two Verſes, was to give account of the Prieſts and Levites that were in the times of the <hi>following High Prieſts,</hi> then there was reaſon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40132:16"/>for mentioning <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Joiada,</hi> but no reaſon at all for the mentioning of <hi>Johanan</hi> and <hi>Jaddua;</hi> for according to him they are not recorded during their time; nay, one of them was not then High Prieſt. And ſo if our Author pleaſe, he hath given us a Reaſon why they ſhould not be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but why they ſhould be mentioned he hath given us no Reaſon. And now does not any Man ſee what great Reaſon our Author had to ask <hi>where</hi> the Difficulties are; and to tell us he can ſee none:
<note place="margin">P. 4.</note> And when he is ſo wofully bewildred and perplexed, that he contradicts the Scriptures, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and common Senſe, to ſolve the Difficulties, to ask, <hi>Where are they?</hi> and <hi>I confeſs I do not ſee any Difficulty,</hi> is ſomewhat extraordinary.</p>
            <p>And this I think is abundantly ſufficient to ſatisfie our Author, that his Reaſons are not unanſwerable: And if I had nothing elſe to doe but to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, I ſhould have taken leave of this Point, but that I find another Anſwer to this, and which I confeſs is not made up of Contradictions, like that of our Author's; and therefore being more deſirous to prove my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, than to anſwer our Author, I ſhall briefly conſider it; and conſider withall whether it be ſufficient to clear this Story of <hi>Joſephus</hi> from the <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition</hi> which I charge upon it. The Anſwer is that which the <hi>Germane</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines made to <hi>Scaliger, That theſe two Verſes were not writ by</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>but inſerted by a later hand.</hi> In anſwer to this I obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe this was an Inſertion by a later Hand, it is plain, that the Inſertor makes the High Prieſthood of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> contemporary; and then the Queſtion returns, What <hi>Darius</hi> was this? Whether <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> or <hi>Codomanus?</hi> If <hi>Nothus,</hi> the Difficulty ſtill remains, and <hi>Jaddus</hi> would have been very near that age at the time aſſigned for <hi>Alexander</hi>'s coming to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and eſpecially if we ſhall farther add, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> reckons him dying about the ſame time that <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> dyed, and which was ſome years after that time of his reputed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> If <hi>Codomanus,</hi> and according to our Author's <hi>Hebrew</hi> Criticiſm, the Heads of the Prieſts and Levites were recorded <hi>over</hi> or <hi>throughout</hi> his Reign, then 'tis unaccountable why they did not ſay, till the Days or Reign of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was ſuch a remarkable <hi>Epocha,</hi> and when their Government received ſuch a remarkable Alteration. Aagain: If <hi>Codomanus,</hi> then I would fain ſee a good Reaſon why the Name of an High Prieſt, and the Heads of the Prieſts and Levites, <hi>recorded</hi> in his time, ſhould at ſuch a diſtance be inſerted into an Hiſtory that concerned matters acted and done almoſt an hundred Years before. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although it be admitted that there have been ſuch Inſertions, yet they have an immediate reference to the Story into which they are inſerted, either by way of Connexion, or Explication of the ſubject Matter, or by immediate Addition or Continuation: as the account of the Death of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is added to his Books by a later hand, and things of the like nature: But to inſert into the middle of a Book an account of Perſons who lived a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40132:17"/>whole Age after, I ſuppoſe is not to be found in Scripture, nor yet in any other Hiſtorian. However let that be as it will, that which I inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this is purely arbitrary, and mere Conjecture, and has no plain Proof to ſupport it; and for ought I know the onely Ground of it was to anſwer the Difficulties of this Story in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and I would refer it to any unprejudiced Man, which is moſt reaſonable; to reject that Story in <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> or to make new and unheard of Methods to interpret the Scriptures: And I wonder what reaſon can be given for putting Strains and Difficulties on the Scriptures, to reconcile <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Is it impoſſible <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhould be in the wrong? And if Men who are ſo very tender of the Credit of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> would not allow him ſo to be, they might as well make the Account in him <hi>inſitious,</hi> to reconcile him to Scripture, as the Scripture Account <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitious,</hi> to reconcile it to <hi>Joſephus.</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. This ſolves one Difficulty by another as great, or greater: When was this Inſertion made? By whom? Upon what cocaſion? And how does it appear? Is there any thing like it in the whole Scripture? And when they come to be compared, and caſt into the Balance, Is there any greater Evidence or Preſumption, that theſe are Inſertions, than that <hi>Joſephus</hi> is miſtaken? Theſe are material Queſtions in the preſent Caſe; and if they cannot be anſwered, (and I ſuppoſe they cannot,) but by bare Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the whole Reaſon of my Argument affects theſe Inſertions, as well as the Story of <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and that is, that it is <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are ſuch Inſertions or no; and conſequently, that <hi>no regular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can be drawn from thence, in reference to Practice.</hi> And I would fain know,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 11.</note> whether any Man can or dare eſtabliſh a point of Practice from ſuch arbitrary Conjectures; and my Concluſion ſtands firm, <hi>That Men who act upon Principles of Sincerity, would be very fearfull of uſing</hi> ſuch things that ſtand upon pure Conjecture <hi>in matters of Practice; for however Chronologers may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> and frame Arguments to reconcile their <hi>Hypotheſes, yet when it comes to a point of Conſcience, Men that have a care of their Souls will hardly venture to act</hi> upon mere Suppoſitions, and conjectural Preſumptions: So that let this Anſwer go as far as it can, it will never extend to my main Concluſion, which is drawn from the <hi>Suſpitiouſneſs</hi> of that Story in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and the Anſwer that is given, is as ſuſpitious as the Story it ſelf. And thus much to the Anſwer of the <hi>Germane</hi> Divines: I now return to our <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here he ſtarts an Objection,
<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> 
               <hi>That if his Interpretation be true,</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah <hi>muſt have lived to a very great Age;</hi> and he anſwers, <hi>No doubt he did ſo,</hi> and he proves it by theſe Steps: <hi>That he was Cup bearer to</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>in the</hi> 20th <hi>of his Reign, when he may be ſuppoſed to have been</hi> 25 <hi>Years of Age; and after that he lived to ſee the High Prieſthood paſs from Father to Son for four Generations, and ſaw a fifth in View,</hi> (Jaddua.) And then adds, <hi>All this might very well be, if</hi> Nehemiah <hi>were born</hi> 470 <hi>Years before Chriſt, and writ in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40132:17"/>the Year</hi> 347 (it ſhould be 374) <hi>before Chriſt.</hi> No doubt of it, all this might then very well be; and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would then be, according to our Author, 104 years old. But what Authority hath our Author for this? Why truly, no bodies but his own; and he might, if he had found it for his turn, have brought down <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Age to the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as ſome others have done, and then it had been but ſaying, <hi>All this might very well be, if</hi> Nehemiah <hi>writ in the Year</hi> 332 <hi>before Chriſt;</hi> and ſo the Matter is fairly proved. At this rate our Author may very eaſily anſwer Objections, and they muſt be ſtrange Difficulties indeed that can ſtand before him. Let a Man but ſuppoſe the main thing in Controverſie, and it is a hard caſe if by the help of that he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all Objections. The Queſtion is concerning the Age of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and our Authour proves it by ſuppoſing it, <hi>if</hi> he was born 470, and wrote 374 years before Chriſt, then all this might be; that is to ſay, if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lived 104 years, then he was 104 years old. And that is the thing to be proved; how does he prove that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was 104 years old, or that he wrote 374 years before Chriſt? Why, it is far eaſier to ſuppoſe ſome things than to prove them; and if they will not prove themſelves, they muſt e'en doe as well as they can, our Author can lend them no Aſſiance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it may be a little diverting to obſerve how our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Computation, and <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Account of this matter agree, whom notwithſtanding he pretends to <hi>vindicate. Joſephus</hi>'s Account is,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the 25th of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and plainly intimates, that he dyed in his Reign: The Author's Account is, that he wrote his Book 374 years before Chriſt, in the beginning of <hi>Johanan</hi>'s High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; which, according to his Calculation, is in the 31ſt of <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes Mnemon,</hi> and how long he might live after is uncertain: Now from the Death of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to the 31ſt of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> is but 91 years, thus computed:

            <p>This, I ſuppoſe, is but a ſmall Difference with a <hi>Vindicator,</hi> who can ſee no Difficulties: In the mean time, he that ſo palpably contradicts <hi>Joſephus,</hi> might, one would think, have been a little ſparing, and not have made ſuch a terrible buſineſs of finding Faults in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> except he thinks that no Body may doe ſo, but he that calls himſelf his <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> However, that which I would draw from hence is, That if our Author believes his own Account, let him deny my Inference if he can,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40132:18"/>That <hi>ſince</hi> Joſephus<hi>'s Errours and Miſtakes concerning theſe times,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 11.</note> are ſo many and groſs, any man that acted upon Principles of Sincerity, would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fearfull to uſe an Example taken out of him in Matters of Practice.</hi> Our Author now and then gives ſome hard words, but in the main is very obliging, and I ought to be thankfull; for though he does not like my way, yet he proves my point as well as I can deſire, and his Premiſſes will fit my Concluſion as well as my own: For our Author hath found a much greater Fault in <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Chronology than I have done; and my Argument returns upon him, if <hi>Joſephus</hi> was ſo notoriouſly out in the Times of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and according to our Author at leaſt 91 years; then it plainly follows, that he that owns him ſo wofully miſtaken, can never himſelf ſafely rely upon his ſole Authority: For I would fain ſee a good reaſon, if <hi>Joſephus</hi> was ſo notoriouſly miſtaken in the time of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he might not as well be miſtaken in the time of <hi>Jaddus. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> was the chief Governour of <hi>Judaea,</hi> as well as <hi>Jaddus;</hi> and 'tis probable that his Reign was recorded in their Chronicles, and publick Matters dated from it; at leaſt they were ſo as much in the Caſe of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> as in the Caſe of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> had the ſame opportunity and means to know the times of one as well as the other: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ſo much miſtaken concerning a Prince and Governour of his own Nation, and one alſo who was reigning not long from thoſe very Times about which is the Controverſie; for, according to our Author, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote his Book but 41 years before the times of <hi>Alexander;</hi> This is plainly argumentative againſt our Author, and he himſelf (if he will be conſiſtent) cannot ſafely depend upon his Relations of thoſe Times, and much leſs draw a practical Inference from an Example in thoſe Times, which ſtands upon nothing elſe but the Authority and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Suppoſe an Engliſh Hiſtorian, and eſpecially ſuch a one as was in the Poſt of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that could examine all the Records of the Countrey, ſhould ſay, that Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> lived and dyed in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. (and the reaſon is yet ſtronger with reſpect to a chief Governour,) whether any Man would depend upon what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered about thoſe Times, which ſtood onely upon his ſingle Aſſertion and Authority.
<note place="margin">Voſſius.</note> I know well enough that ſome, to ſave the Credit of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this point, ſay, that the Times or Reigns of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings (during that Monarchy) were not ſo well known then, as they have been ſince; but this is not only ſaid without Proof, but 'tis manifeſtly falſe: For we find in Scripture, (as far as the Scripture goes,) that the Names of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings were recorded, and there is no reaſon to think but they were ſo afterwards; and it is ridiculous to think, that in <hi>Judaea,</hi> which was a Branch of the Monarchy, and under the Government and Authority of thoſe Kings, the Times of their Kings ſhould not be known; but one King, eſpecially at our Author's diſtance of 91 years, ſhould be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40132:18"/>confounded for another. Beſides, the Matter in Controverſie is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it, which is the High Prieſt's <hi>taking an Oath of Fidelity</hi> to thoſe Kings, (and which <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions too,) and probably enough all other great Officers in places of Truſt and Importance; and it would be very ſtrange, if the Reigns of thoſe Kings could not be known, to whom reſpectively they took an Oath of Allegiance. Our Author flurts at <hi>Calviſius,</hi> and tells me,
<note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I could not have found a fitter Man to take my part; for he had a Quarrel againſt</hi> Joſephus, <hi>for writing ſuch things as would not conſiſt with his Chronology.</hi> And it ſeems our Author hath the ſame Quarrel too, (onely he is a little more courtly than <hi>Calviſius,</hi> and calls it <hi>Vindicating;</hi>) for <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes ſuch things as will no more conſiſt with our Author's Chronology, than they will with that of <hi>Calviſius;</hi> and to ſay the Truth, our Author will fit my turn every jot as well as <hi>Calviſius,</hi> and my Argument concludes as well from what our Author ſays, as from what <hi>Calviſius</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>Our Author adds, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Jaddus <hi>being High Prieſt at the time of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes<hi>'s Death, is not onely groundleſs; but highly improbable;</hi> and his reaſon is, <hi>For if this had been true, there muſt have been living and dying no leſs than five High Prieſts, in one direct Line, from Father to Son, in the ſpace of</hi> 22 <hi>years.</hi> And how does our Author prove this? Why, he does it by enumeration of Particulars, and plain deduction, thus; as <hi>Joiakim, Eliaſhib, Joiada, Johanan;</hi> there are four, and the fifth is <hi>Jaddus,</hi> who was juſt come to the Prieſthood; and therefore there muſt needs be five High Prieſts <hi>living and dying</hi> in that ſpace, becauſe <hi>one</hi> of the five was living, and juſt entred upon the High Prieſthood. Now who would ever expect that our Author ſhould <hi>ſee</hi> any Difficulties, when he cannot <hi>ſee</hi> that he contradicts himſelf the very next Line. But five High Prieſts <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying</hi> in 22 years, would make a great wonderment whether it were true or no. And juſt ſuch another is the Caſe of <hi>Joiakim,</hi> of whom our Author ſays, that <hi>it appears that he dyed the ſame year, i. e.</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> and that is again any time even in the beginning of the <hi>ſame year:</hi> For he tells us immediately, that <hi>His Son</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>was High Prieſt at the time when the Walls of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was building;</hi> and that is yet again very ſoon after <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> So that according to our Author's account, by <hi>living and dying,</hi> when it reſpects <hi>Joiakim,</hi> one of the five, it means <hi>dying,</hi> and not living; when another, <hi>(Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,)</hi> it means <hi>living,</hi> and not <hi>dying:</hi> And if a Man will not take theſe for <hi>unanſwerable Reaſons,</hi> he is querulous and unreaſonable; and as our Author ſays, <hi>is angry, and greedy of Objections againſt</hi> Joſephus,
<note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and did not regard what might be ſaid in his Vindication.</hi> However at laſt, as to this Matter of <hi>living and dying,</hi> the five High Prieſts are come to three, and whether that was <hi>onely</hi> in the ſpace of 22 years we come now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40132:19"/>
            <p> For the Proof of this our Author adds, Firſt, <hi>His</hi> (Jaddus<hi>'s</hi>) <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's great Grandfather,</hi> Joiakim, <hi>was High Prieſt within the Time while</hi> Nehemiah <hi>was Governour;</hi> and adds farthermore, <hi>that is certain,</hi> but gives us no proof of it, onely refers in the margin to <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.28. (the 26. it ſhould be.) And what is ſaid there for our Author's purpoſe? Why, the Text ſaith, that <hi>Theſe</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the chief of the Levites, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the verſes before,) <hi>were in the days of</hi> Joiakim, <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeſhua, <hi>and in the days of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>the Governour, and of</hi> Ezra <hi>the Prieſt:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it plainly follows, by <hi>unanſwerable Reaſon,</hi> that <hi>Joiakim</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> were contemporaries; as if it were impoſſible for them that were <hi>chief of the Levites</hi> in the time of <hi>Joiakim,</hi> (though he dyed ſome years before <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>) to be alſo <hi>chief of the Levites</hi> in the times of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who was Governour ſome time after. He might as well have made <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> contemporary; for in the ſame Chapter (v. 27.) it is ſaid, <hi>All</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the days of</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>and in the days of</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, <hi>gave the Portion of the Singers,</hi> &amp;c. This is juſt ſuch another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as becauſe Bp. <hi>Bilſon</hi> was Bp. of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in the days of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and K. <hi>James,</hi> therefore Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and K. <hi>James</hi> were contemporaries in their Government. Well; I perceive when Men are once ſet upon <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Reaſons,</hi> there is no end of them. But however, as to the time of <hi>Joiakim</hi>'s dying, our Author can ſay nothing to, but it is plain that his Son <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was High Prieſt when the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that is, when it firſt began to be built; and that is plainly, ſoon after <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Compare Neh. 3.1. with 2.11.</note> and he might be High Prieſt long enough before that, for any thing our Author ſaith to the contrary. However <hi>Joſephus,</hi> whom our Author <hi>vindicates</hi> and <hi>contradicts,</hi> as he finds it for his purpoſe,) plainly places <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> in the time of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and as plainly ſays, that <hi>Joiakim</hi> was dead, and <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was High Prieſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came up to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And then our Author's 22 years for three High Prieſts, might have been 62, or at leaſt 52; and that would not have been ſuch a wonderfull Matter. Or however, ſuppoſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> miſtaken, and that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as it is plain he did) in the 20th of <hi>Artaxerxes, Eliaſhib</hi> was then High Prieſt; and he might have been ſo, for any thing our Author knows, ſome at leaſt, if not many years before; and then his 22 years may be 25, or more, and no body knows how many more. Well; but our Author proves it, Eliaſhib <hi>was High Prieſt when the Wall of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was building,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the 20th of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>) <hi>And he was High Prieſt the</hi> 32d of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhib <hi>continued much longer, as I underſtand it; but ſuppoſe he dyed that very year.</hi> But before we proceed any farther, how does our Author prove that <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was High Prieſt in the 32d of <hi>Artaxerxes?</hi> Why, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us again in the Margin to <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.28. Now this proves his point very extraordinarily. The Words are, <hi>And one of the Sons of</hi> Joiada,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40132:19"/>
               <hi>the Son of</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>the High Prieſt, was Son-in-law to</hi> Sanballat, <hi>the Horonite.</hi> From whence our Author concludes, that <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was at that time High Prieſt. Now we are to remember, that our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote his Book immediately after <hi>Johanan</hi> came to be High Prieſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Son of <hi>Joiada,</hi> and the Grandſon of this <hi>Eliaſhib; i. e.</hi> according to his own account about 37 years after <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> dyed: and that is again about 60 years after the 32d of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> And yet forſooth upon the cloſing up his Book, and ending it, becauſe he mentions the Son of <hi>Joiada,</hi> the Son of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> the High Prieſt, it muſt needs be concluded that then <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was High Prieſt, though it perfectly contradicts all that our Author hath ſaid upon this Argument. But this I ſuppoſe we are to take for one of our Author's <hi>unanſwerable Reaſons.</hi> Now for my part I ſhould be glad to ſee <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and let <hi>unanſwerable</hi> alone; for of all the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that ever I met with, <hi>unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reaſons</hi> are the worſt. For all that, as if our Author had punctually prov'd his Point, he adds, <hi>Suppoſe he</hi> (Eliaſhib) <hi>dyed that very year,</hi> (the 32d of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>) <hi>there muſt be ſome time allowed for his Son</hi> Joiada <hi>after him, and then for his Grandchild</hi> Johanan; <hi>but after the</hi> 32d <hi>of</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>there were but</hi> 8 <hi>years more before the end of his Reign.</hi> And then adds, <hi>We have ſcarce known a Change of five Popes in the time that he allows for ſo many to come and go in a Hereditary Succeſſion.</hi> As for five <hi>coming and going,</hi> I have told him already they are but three; and therefore the allowance of five is his own allowance, but none of mine: and I hope, even in our own memories, not onely three, but three times three Popes have ſat in the Chair in the ſpace of 26, or 30 years. But as to his compariſon, 'tis true according to preſent Cuſtome they chuſe only ſuch Perſons to be Popes, who are of very great Age; but this is accidental: But if we conſider the nature of the thing, 'tis much more reaſonable that Perſons who are ſucceſſively elected into an Office, ſhould for the generality continue longer in that Office, than when it goes by hereditary Succeſſion; and the Reaſon is plain, for the Childrens Life is <hi>concurrent</hi> with the Parents, and ſo much as is added to the Father's time of Poſſeſſion, is ſubſtracted from the next Heir, and his Life, though not his Poſſeſſion, wears out concurrently with his Predeceſſor; and if at any time in hereditary Succeſſions a Predeceſſor lives to ſo great an age, ſo much of his Son's age is worn out too, and his time of Poſſeſſion muſt conſequently be the leſs, as he is ſo much older when he comes into Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And therefore I cannot tell, for my Life, what our Author means when he adds, <hi>And then the age of</hi> Jaddus <hi>being conſidered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> (<hi>of which our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector ſaith when he came to be High Prieſt, the leaſt we can allow is</hi> 30 <hi>years, and it is probable it was much more,</hi>) <hi>if it was but</hi> 30 <hi>years, then the age of</hi> Joiakim <hi>when he dyed, muſt have been at leaſt</hi> 90 <hi>years, his Son</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>at leaſt</hi> 62, <hi>his Son</hi> Joiada <hi>near</hi> 70, <hi>his Son</hi> Johanan <hi>near</hi> 60, <hi>and each of theſe it is probable much more; and four of theſe muſt have been born when their Fathers were but</hi> 20 <hi>year old.</hi> Now at firſt ſight a Man would imagine the Inference was clean
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40132:20"/>contrary, and that becauſe <hi>Jaddus</hi> came to be then High Prieſt, therefore thoſe before him, his Father and Grandfather, did not live to ſo great ages; and if they muſt live to ſo great ages, if <hi>Jaddus</hi> came to be High Prieſt the laſt of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> what ages muſt they be of, if he came to be High Prieſt (as our Author intimates) the 17th of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and which was, according to his account, 83 years after? And if they muſt be of ſuch ages if <hi>Jaddus</hi> came to the Prieſthood at 30, what muſt they be if he came (as according to our Author) to be High Prieſt at 63 years of age? But this I ſuppoſe he did not think on, and what was in his Head when he writ this I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe; and methinks the Author ſhould have been ſo kind to his Reader, to have proved the Conſequence that he charges here upon my Aſſertion, and not have left him to have made it out himſelf, eſpecially when it requires ſuch extraordinary Skill to make it intelligible, not only to a common but to any Reader at all; for I am affraid it would puzzle all the Arithmetici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in Chriſtendom, to make any account of it, as our Author hath laid it: For ſuppoſe <hi>Joiakim</hi> dyed at 90, and the other four born when their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were but 20, the ſtate would be thus: When <hi>Joiakim</hi> at the time of of his Death was 90, at the ſame time his Son <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> being born when his Father was 20, would be 70, his Son <hi>Joiada</hi> 50, <hi>Johanan</hi> 30, and <hi>Jaddus</hi> 10. But then what is the meaning of his Son <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> being 62 when he dyed, when according to this account he muſt be 70 when he came to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: In like manner our Author ſays <hi>Johanan</hi> muſt be near 60 when he dyed, when yet according to this account he could be but 50; for if <hi>Jaddus</hi> was born when <hi>Johanan</hi> was 20 years old, then when <hi>Jaddus</hi> was 30, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanan</hi> was 50. Theſe therefore are myſtical Inferences and Riddles, and ſo muſt remain till our Author explains them. In the mean time, if there were any Difficulties in the ages of theſe High Prieſts, as our Author, by conſequence from my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> calculates them, they are plainly greater from his own: For according to him <hi>Jaddus</hi> lived to be 83 years old, he was High Prieſt 20 years according to him, then when he came to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he was 62; and then ſuppoſing his Father <hi>Johanan</hi> 26 when <hi>Jaddus</hi> was born, <hi>Johanan</hi> when he dyed muſt be 89. In like manner take the ſame courſe upwards to the reſt of the High Prieſts: <hi>Johanan,</hi> according to him was High Prieſt 32 years, then when he came to the Prieſthood he was 57; and to this add 26, as his Father's age when he was born, then <hi>Joiada</hi> when he dyed muſt have been 83. <hi>Joiada</hi> was High Prieſt 36, deduct that from 83, and when he became High Prieſt he was 47; add to this 26, as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's age at his Birth, and then <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> his Father when he dyed muſt have been 73. <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was High Prieſt 34, deduct that from 73; and then when he became High Prieſt he was 39; to this add 26, as his Father's age when he was born, and then <hi>Joiakim</hi> at his death muſt have been 65. And now on which ſide is the Difficulty? Which is greater, to ſay <hi>that</hi> Joiakim <hi>when he dyed muſt have been</hi> 90, Eliaſhib 62, Joiada <hi>near</hi> 70, Johanan <hi>near</hi> 60;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40132:20"/>or that which is the Conſequence of our Author's account, <hi>Joiakim</hi> when he dyed muſt be 65, <hi>Eliashib</hi> 73, <hi>Joiada</hi> 83, <hi>Johanan</hi> 89, and <hi>Jaddus</hi> 83? And 'tis probable, if this account be true, it was much more; for if any one of theſe Prieſts had not Children at the age of 26, if their eldeſt ſhould prove a Daughter, or infirm, and unfit for the Prieſthood, or ſhould dye, or in ſhort if each of them had not at that age the very Son that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, then ſtill the whole account muſt be proportionably length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And to conclude this in our Author's words, <hi>If any one of theſe things did not happen, then our</hi> Author's <hi>groundwork falls; but that all things happened thus I think there is no Probability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author having ſaid this to diſprove my Account, comes to make good his own; and ſuppoſe for Quietneſs ſake that I ſhould grant him all that he has ſaid, how indifferently ſoever he hath proved it, that there are Difficulties in my Account, and it is not probable; What then? Why then I ought not to eſtabliſh any Doctrine upon it, nor draw any practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from it, nor confirm or prove a Point of Conſcience from any ſuch difficult and ſuſpitious Stories. Nor do I; but however that is the Caſe I diſpute againſt. And if our Author could ſhew as many Difficulties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities in my account as he pretends, What is that to the purpoſe? Do the Difficulties in my account clear the Difficulties that are in another account? That indeed is an Argument againſt my Account, but 'tis none at all againſt my Inference and Deduction, which ſtands good againſt him, except he can clear up his own account, as well as find faults in mine. And what does he ſay for that? <hi>On the other hand,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
               <hi>there is nothing impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in that Account which I offered before.</hi> And ſuppoſe I ſhould grant him that too, What then? Is every account true that is not <hi>improbable?</hi> Or, may a Man deduce Conſequences for Practice in high and important Duties, from every Story that is not <hi>improbable?</hi> How eaſie is it in Matters of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and abſtruſe Hiſtory, to frame Schemes to our ſelves that have no <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability</hi> in them! But is that a Reaſon to argue from thence to Practice? But let us ſee how <hi>probable</hi> our Author makes his account: He tells us, Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus <hi>might have been born any year before his Father</hi> Johanan <hi>came to be High Prieſt,</hi> (<hi>at which time I conceive with good ground that the Book of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>was written,</hi>) <hi>and yet</hi> Jaddus <hi>might be mentioned as he is in that Book; but I ſuppoſed him born thirty years before, in compliance with the moſt learned Primate, who reckons that</hi> Jaddus <hi>might be about</hi> 83 <hi>years old at his Death; ſo he judged, by comparing the Scriptures with</hi> Joſephus. <hi>I attribute much to his judgment in theſe Matters; but not to reſt upon that onely, I have alſo conſidered the years of the High Prieſts above mentioned; they are recorded in</hi> Chronicon Paſchale, <hi>but I think better in</hi> Syncellus; <hi>who though he doth not quote his Author, yet is reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably preſumed to have tranſcribed them from</hi> Julius Affricanus, <hi>an Author that lived little more than an hundred years after</hi> Joſephus, <hi>and living in the ſame Countrey, might have his Information from them that knew as well as</hi> Joſephus
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40132:21"/>
               <hi>himſelf. In placing the years of theſe Prieſts, I begin from the Death of</hi> Jaddus, <hi>who is ſaid to have dyed about the ſame time with</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great; reckoning from thence upwards, the Death of</hi> Joiakim <hi>will fall in the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>which exactly agrees with the account of his Death I have given from Scripture: And indeed there is nothing ſaid of any of theſe Prieſts, either in the holy Scripture or in</hi> Joſephus, <hi>but what very well conſiſts with the account of their years given us in this Catalogue. That you may the better judge of this, I have given you a ſhort View of their years, compared with thoſe of the Kings of</hi> Perſia, <hi>as they are in</hi> Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy's <hi>Canon.</hi> And then he ſubjoins the Catalogue, which will be conſidered preſently. In anſwer to all this I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Author is miſtaken when he ſays, <hi>there is nothing ſaid of any of theſe Prieſts in</hi> Joſephus, <hi>but what very well conſiſts with the account of their years in this Catalogue.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Joſephus</hi> places the beginning of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi>'s High Prieſthood in the Reign of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and our Author in the Catalogue places it in the 20th of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which I think is not very conſiſtent, as our Author would make us believe.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Our Authour makes his Calculation from the times of the High Prieſthood of the ſeveral High Prieſts, which is a very doubtfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Ground to proceed on, and, if poſſible, more ſuſpitious than the Story our Author endeavours to prove by it. He indeed intimates, that it was tranſcribed from <hi>Africanus,</hi> who lived in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and might know as well as <hi>Joſephus;</hi> but he hath no proof of this: And he tells us <hi>Syncellus</hi> doth not <hi>quote</hi> his Author, onely it may be <hi>reaſonably preſumed.</hi> But <hi>Preſumptions</hi> are but <hi>Preſumptions,</hi> let them be never ſo <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and not ſufficient to determine a Man in a Matter of this nature; however, let that account be either <hi>Syncellus</hi>'s own, or <hi>Africanus</hi>'s, or any other's, this I have to ſay:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That there is no ſubſtantial Ground for the Account it ſelf; the Scripture hath nothing at all of it, nor yet <hi>Joſephus:</hi> They name the High Prieſts indeed, but give no account how long each of them were ſo. And our Author's Reaſon is none at all, <hi>That</hi> Africanus <hi>lived in the Countrey of</hi> Judaea, <hi>and might have his Information from them that knew as well as</hi> Joſephus <hi>himſelf;</hi> for though he did live at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> yet he was no native of the Countrey, but an <hi>Africane,</hi> and that is collected to be the reaſon of his Name, <hi>(Africanus;)</hi> and when he did live there, it was a long time after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Temple was burnt, and the Town ſack'd, and by reaſonable Preſumption (our Author's Argument) all their publick Records burnt or loſt, when many Millions of them were killed, infinite Numbers diſperſed, eſpecially at the time of <hi>Africanus,</hi> who lived about 140 years after; he was like to receive from a poor remnant an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent account of the Times of the High Prieſts, that were 6 or 700 years before. And where is it ſaid in <hi>Syncellus,</hi> that the account that was given of the High Prieſts, is what was taken by Tradition from the <hi>Jews?</hi> Any
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40132:21"/>that reads <hi>Syncellus</hi> will find it clear other wife, that he adjuſts his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of the times of the Prieſts not by Tradition, or Records, but by Inference and Deduction, as in the Caſe of <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> the firſt High Prieſt after the Return from the Captivity;
<note place="margin">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. Syncellus P. 240.</note> for he plainly argues againſt ſome body who had ſaid that <hi>Jeſhua</hi> was High Prieſt 31 years. And he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove the contrary; for that Jeſhua's <hi>High Prieſthood commenced the firſt of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>according to</hi> Ezra 11.2. <hi>where he is ſet in conjunction with</hi> Zerubbabel, <hi>and that</hi> Jeſhua <hi>dyed the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> Darius, <hi>and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that the Continuance of</hi> Jeſhua's <hi>High Prieſthood was</hi> 60 <hi>years.</hi> Here is nothing at all of Tradition, or receiving Information from the <hi>Jews,</hi> but an Account made out by chronological Computation, and which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is alſo falſe: So that this matter of receiving Information of the Inhabitants of <hi>Judaea,</hi> is nothing elſe but our Author's Fancy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever how does this appear, that this account of the High Prieſts in <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> was tranſcribed out of <hi>Africanus?</hi> That needs another Reaſon; or what methods will our Author give us to diſtinguiſh between what is <hi>Syncellus</hi>'s own, and what is taken out of <hi>Africanus?</hi> A Man muſt have very good Eyes that can ſee the difference. <hi>Goar</hi> indeed, the laſt Editor of <hi>Syncellus,</hi> hath fairly offered at it; but, (1.) No Man will take all his Conjectures for plain Proofs, eſpecially when it concerns a Matter of Practice. And, (2.) <hi>Goar</hi> himſelf doth not aſſign the account of the High Prieſts continuance in their Prieſthood to <hi>Africanus.</hi> From all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether theſe two things plainly follow:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no ſubſtantial Reaſon can be given, that the Account of the High Prieſts in <hi>Syncellus</hi> was tranſcribed out of <hi>Africanus.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it were tranſcribed from <hi>Africanus,</hi> notwithſtanding no ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reaſon can be given of the Account it ſelf. And this will yet farther appear, if we conſider.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great Variety and Diſcrepancy that is in all ſorts of Authors and Chronologers concerning this very Matter; and as far as my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſerves, I do not find two who are of any repute, and have made it their buſineſs to conſider it, that are of the ſame mind about it. I ſhall give the Reader a ſhort Scheme, and then draw my Inferences from it.</p>
            <p>The Account of the High Prieſts continuance in their reſpective Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoods, are thus, according to different Authors.</p>

            <p> And I could add many more, where there is the ſame or a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement, but this is ſufficient to ſhew what an excellent Method our Author hath taken, to prove the truth of a fuſpitious Story, by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> that is every way as ſuſpitious as the Story it ſelf. And the Truth is, any Man that is converſant in theſe kind of Studies, will plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, becauſe there is no certain account of theſe things, that all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have taken a liberty, and have varied the times of theſe High Prieſts, and have made them more or leſs, according as it might ſerve their reſpective <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> and might reconcile them to the reſpective Computations of Chronology they thought moſt reaſonable. But this it ſeems our Author thought moſt for his purpoſe, he is for clearing the Difficulties of a Story by Proofs as difficult as the Story it ſelf. And therefore before he had gone any farther, he ought to have proved that <hi>Syncellus</hi>'s Account of the times of thoſe High Prieſts, is a true Account, and which we ought to rely on, againſt all Mankind; and he may yet prove it if he can; and if he could prove it, it would plainly deſtroy all his Book, as we ſhall ſee preſently.

He takes the times of the High Prieſts out of <hi>Chronicon Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chale,</hi> or, as he ſays, <hi>better</hi> out of <hi>Syncellus;</hi> and then to make up his Computation, he <hi>compares them with the Kings of</hi> Perſia <hi>in</hi> Ptolomy<hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> although <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon takes no notice of the High Prieſts, nor yet do the Authors from whom he takes the Account of the High Prieſts, take notice of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon; and which is yet more, nor do they place the reſpective High Prieſts as our Author hath placed them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon; and to ſhew our Author's excellent way of proving things, I ſhall give the Reader the Schemes before him.</p>

            <p> And now does not any Man ſee how our Author's account and that of the <hi>Chr. Paſch.</hi> do agree? He determines the High Prieſthood of <hi>Jaddus</hi> about the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Chron. Paſch.</hi> determines it in the Reign of <hi>Ochus;</hi> and plainly aſſerts, that not <hi>Jaddus,</hi> but his Son <hi>Onias</hi> was High Prieſt at the latter end of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and during the Reign of <hi>Arſes, Codomanus</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> which is as fair a Proof of my Point, as I could deſire. But our Author is for taking the <hi>Prieſts</hi> from one Author, and the <hi>Kings</hi> from another, and then putting them together, as he finds occaſion; which is ſuch a way of proving things as is not ordinary to be met with. And at this rate he may, if he pleaſe, make Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> contemporary with <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour. But if it was allowed him, it will by no means ſerve his turn; for I defie any Man, that can but tell an hundred, who by comparing theſe High Prieſts in the <hi>Chron. Paſch.</hi> and <hi>Syncellus,</hi> with the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s <hi>Canon,</hi> can make the time of <hi>Jaddus</hi> Prieſthood contemporary with <hi>Alexander.</hi> And for the clear manifeſtation of this, I ſhall ſet and compare them together.</p>

            <p>Now to ſtate theſe Accounts exactly here are two things to be obſerved:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Time of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Reign, whether it is to be computed from the time of his being fully poſſeſſed of the whole <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, and alſo as to his making the Edict to releaſe the Jews in Captivity. But as to that Point, it is indifferent to me, let our Author, or any Man elſe, take what time they pleaſe for it, the Scripture ſays it was the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and let
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40132:23"/>that <hi>firſt</hi> be dated at what time they pleaſe of his Reign, tis all one in the preſent Caſe, I had before, by the modeſteſt Computation I could make, aſſigned 3 years before his death; and if our Author does not like that, he may aſſign it 2 or 1 year before. It is certain it was ſome time before, and if but 2 years before, the Computation will ſtand thus: That the whole time of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, or from the time of the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the Return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from Captivity to the laſt of <hi>Darius,</hi> is 201; and <hi>Alexander</hi>'s 8 years Reign being added to it, is 209. And this, if I miſtake not, is a Conceſſion more than needs, and I believe more than our Author can demand: but at preſent ſuppoſe it, and it will doe him no ſervice; for,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing to be obſerved is concerning the Account of <hi>Syncellus,</hi> which firſt is manifeſtly falſe; for he attributes to <hi>Jeſhua</hi> 60 years, to his Son <hi>Joiakim</hi> 36. Now according to the Account of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Reign, or Edict to reſtore the <hi>Jews,</hi> (which according to <hi>Syncellus</hi> is contemporary with the beginning or <hi>Jeſhua</hi>'s Prieſthood,) then if this Edict was but two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, <hi>Joiakim</hi>'s Prieſthood muſt determine, and he muſt dye the 29th of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> when according to the Scripture, and to our Author himſelf, his Son <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> was High Prieſt the 20th of the ſame <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> And therefore, 2. <hi>Syncellus</hi>'s Miſtake plainly aroſe from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Principality, with the firſt year according to Scripture Account, which is generally ſuppoſed to reſpect not the firſt year of his Principality, but the firſt year of his Monarchy over <hi>Perſia.</hi> But be that as it will, 'tis all one; for <hi>Syncellus</hi> attributing to <hi>Cyrus</hi> 31 years, and for that Reaſon reckoning the High Prieſthood of <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> as contemporary and concurrent with it, it comes all to the ſame purpoſe; and if we reckon according to <hi>Syncellus,</hi> inſtead of computing from two years before <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Death, we muſt compute from 31; and this brings the Matter to the ſame Iſſue, and according to that Compute, <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s High Prieſthood muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in the days of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and not in the time of <hi>Alexander:</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <hi>Syncellus</hi> plainly aſſerts, 3. That <hi>Jeſhua</hi>'s High Prieſthood did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the 20th of <hi>Darius;</hi> and then according to that Calculation <hi>Jaddus</hi> his Prieſthood muſt determine in the time of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and 20 years before the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> according to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon. And now let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe Accounts, and ſee whether it be poſſible for any man taking the Accounts of the High Prieſts from <hi>Chronicon Paſchale</hi> and <hi>Syncellus,</hi> to make <hi>Jaddus</hi> living at the time of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Account of the times of theſe High Prieſts, according to <hi>Chr. Paſch.</hi> is — 190 y.</p>
            <p>The whole time of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, ſuppoſing <hi>Cyrus</hi> but the 2d before his Death to the laſt of <hi>Codomanus,</hi> is 200, and to the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> 8 more, in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon, is — 208 y.</p>
            <p>That is, that by comparing the account of the High Prieſts in <hi>Chronicon Paſchale</hi> with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon, it plainly appears, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40132:23"/>
               <hi>Jaddas</hi> dyed in the time of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and that his Son <hi>Onias,</hi> and not he, was High Prieſt at the time of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and according to the loweſt Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation there is 18 years difference between our Author when he compares them, and what is the true Computation according to that <hi>Chronicon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then for <hi>Syncellus,</hi> from the beginning of <hi>Joiakim</hi>'s High Prieſthood (the 20th of <hi>Darius</hi>) to the laſt of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> is — 158 y.</p>
            <p>From the 20th of <hi>Darius</hi> to the laſt of <hi>Codomanus,</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon, is 170, and adding the 8 of <hi>Alexander,</hi> is — 178 y.</p>
            <p>And therefore by comparing the High Prieſts in <hi>Syncellus</hi> with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon, it plainly appears, that our Author's Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but a Miſtake of 20 years, even as much as the whole time of <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s High Prieſthood. And it does as plainly appear that <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Prieſthood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Reign of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and not in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and much leſs, as our Author aſſigns, about the time of his Death.</p>
            <p>And ſo our Author hath prov'd the Matter on my ſide, a great deal better than I could do, or had ſo much as attempted: Alas! I onely argued that the Story was <hi>ſuſpitious;</hi> but our Author gives us Evidence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that it is not true, nor can be; for if he will ſtand by his own Method, and compare the Account of the Times of theſe High Prieſts, as they are in <hi>Chron. Paſch.</hi> and <hi>Syncellus,</hi> with the account of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon. 'Tis as plain as the Sun, that <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s High Prieſthood ended ſome years before <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Expedition into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and therefore was not alive when <hi>Alexander</hi> beſieged <hi>Tyre;</hi> and conſequently <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Story concerning <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> cannot be true; which I confeſs is a better Proof for my Aſſertion, than any I have offered at. This therefore deſerves Thanks and due Acknowledgment, and which by theſe Preſents I return to our Author. And if he had been pleaſed to vindicate Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> as he hath vindicated <hi>Joſephus,</hi> he would have obliged me for ever; for then I do not queſtion but Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> would have been anſwered much better than I have done.</p>
            <p>Our Author now comes to conſider the Ages of <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and tells us, <hi>For the firſt of theſe he is ſpoken of by</hi> Joſephus,
<note place="margin">p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>with that Care which one would have thought might have prevented this Objection;</hi> and yet however it comes to paſs, moſt Men that have well conſidered it have made this Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never thought that the Care and Caution of <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s expreſſing it, would ſo eaſily take it off: And for any thing I know Dr. <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> was the firſt who thought of the Anſwer our Author hath given to it, and our Author I ſuppoſe out of him: And it was abſolutely neceſſary for him to find out ſome expedient for this; for otherwiſe his Chronology would have been one of the wildeſt things in the World; for he places <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> does, in the Reign of <hi>Xerxes;</hi> and then if <hi>Sanballat,</hi> that diſturbed <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> had lived to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s taking of <hi>Tyre,</hi> he muſt have been 185 years old; nay, according to his account, 220 years
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40132:24"/>old; for he aſſigns to the Reign of <hi>Artaxernes Mnemon</hi> 62 years, and makes the Continuance of the <hi>Perfian</hi> Monarchy to be 253 years: And therefore to ſolve this Objection, which lay ſo obvious againſt him, he found out this Anſwer, and tells us as our Author does, That there were two <hi>Sanballats;</hi> one the <hi>Horonite,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> the other ſent into <hi>Samaria</hi> by <hi>Codomanus.</hi> But he gives no Proof of this, but onely the account of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus:</hi> But that ſignifies nothing in the preſent Controverſie; for <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaying that <hi>Sanballat</hi> was ſent by <hi>Darius,</hi> who was driven out by <hi>Alexander,</hi> if it appears that <hi>Sanballat</hi> was <hi>Prefect</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> upon the coming of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the Scripture account, and the Ground of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and can never be anſwered by <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s ſaying <hi>Sanballat</hi> was ſent by <hi>Darius,</hi> who was beaten by <hi>Alexander;</hi> for the Queſtion is, whether there were two; and <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentioning onely one, is not an Argument that there were two, but a reaſon that he hath miſplaced that one that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Scriptures mention but one <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> likewiſe tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſame Story with the Scriptures, mentions but one <hi>Sanballat,</hi> though he has placed his <hi>Sanballat</hi> many years after the Scripture account. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the ſame, as Prefect of <hi>Syria,</hi> both in the Scripture, and in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and this I think a fair Reaſon, that the <hi>Sanballats</hi> in the Scripture, and in <hi>Joſephus</hi> are but one, though the placing of them are different, and which is the Ground of the <hi>Objection.</hi> Our Author farther adds, (which <hi>Voſſius</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought on,) and makes it the Ground of his Anſwer, the Difference between <hi>Horonaim</hi> and <hi>Chutha;</hi> and becauſe the Scripture calls <hi>Sanballat</hi> the <hi>Horonite,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls his <hi>Sanballat</hi> a <hi>Chuthaean;</hi> therefore our Author concludes they muſt not be the ſame <hi>Sanballat,</hi> becauſe of their different Original and Extraction, and ſays, <hi>Who would have thought that this</hi> Chuthae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>ſhould have been miſtaken for the</hi> Moabite <hi>of</hi> Horonaim, <hi>whom</hi> Nehemiah <hi>found in</hi> Paleſtine 100 <hi>years before;</hi> and then takes ſome pains to prove that <hi>Horonaim</hi> was in <hi>Moab,</hi> and that <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s <hi>Sanballat</hi> was a <hi>Moabite.</hi> And what does that ſignifie? For beſides that the Diſtinction of ſuch additional Names and Characters is a very ſlender Proof of the Diſtinction of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for Men may have ſuch additional Characters upon ſeveral accounts, and there are Inſtances enough of it in Scripture. However here are two things conſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Queſtion is, whether there were in thoſe reſpective Times two <hi>Sanballats,</hi> and to ſay that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who writes the ſame Story, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but one, calls his a <hi>Chuthaean,</hi> and therefore he is not the ſame, is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the Queſtion; for why may not <hi>Joſephus</hi> be miſtaken as well in the Pedigree, as he is in the times of <hi>Sanballat?</hi> But ſuppoſe he is not, and hath given his Extraction right,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why might not the <hi>Chuthaeans</hi> (at leaſt ſome of them) be tranſlated to <hi>Moab,</hi> upon the Conqueſt of that Country, as well as to <hi>Samaria</hi> upon the Conqueſt of that; this was uſual in the Eaſtern Conqueſts, to tranſplant
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40132:24"/>their own People, and remove the Natives, (and the Caſe of <hi>Samaria</hi> is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of it;) and then <hi>Sanballat</hi> might be called an <hi>Horonite</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Birth and laſt Habitation in the Scripture, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> might call him a <hi>Chuthaean</hi> with reſpect to the Nation or People from whom he was deſcended. This is uſual in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> eſpecially with reſpect to them, who calls the <hi>Samaritanes Chuthaeans,</hi> though they had lived in <hi>Samaria</hi> for ſeveral Generations. He calls them ſo in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time, which was about 400 years after their Planting there; and he does ſo often afterwards when he is angry, tho' he wrote his Book near 800 years after their being ſettled in that Country; which is juſt to as much purpoſe as to call Engliſhmen <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Danes,</hi> or <hi>Normans.</hi> And I wonder why he might not for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon call <hi>Sanballat</hi> a <hi>Chuthaean,</hi> though neither he nor any of his Anceſtors for five or ſix Generations had ever ſeen that Countrey. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf plainly favours this, for all that he ſays is, that he was of the <hi>Race</hi> of the <hi>Chuthaeans, from which the</hi> Samaritanes <hi>eame;</hi> and which he might be well enough, and yet a <hi>Horonite</hi> by Birth, and his Anceſtors might have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Moab</hi> for ſome Generations. And the ſame angry reaſon which made him generally call the <hi>Samaritanes Chuthaeans,</hi> might make him ſay the ſame of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> though he might come no more immediately from <hi>Chutha</hi> than the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>However the Force of the Objection does not lie in the Names being the ſame, which yet is more than our Author can fairly anſwer; but that join'd with other conſiderable Circumſtances. There is not onely an Identity of Name, but of ſeveral other material Things. The <hi>Sanballat</hi> in Scripture, and the <hi>Sanballat</hi> in <hi>Joſephus</hi> was Prefect of <hi>Syria,</hi> and had a Daughter mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Son of the High Prieſt, who was obſtinate, and would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fake his forbidden Marriage, and for which he was deprived of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Theſe are the Characters of the Caſe of <hi>Sanballat</hi> in the Scriptures, and they are the very ſame of <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s <hi>Sanballat;</hi> and where there is both the ſame Name, and alſo a harmony of ſuch and ſo many extraordinary Circumſtances, to diſpute whether they are the ſame Perſon, is to ſtrain upon the Ingenuity and common Reaſon of Mankind. I had told him before,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 9.</note>
               <q>Such a Concurrence of all Circumſtances, is like the Platonick year, and is not likely to return ſooner; or if ſuch a ſtrange thing ſhould happen, is it probable that all Hiſtories would have been ſilent of it?</q> But of this our Author takes no manner of Notice, but talks of the ſtrangeneſs that <hi>there ſhould be two of a Name,</hi> (as if the Objection conſiſted in that;) and then he takes ſome pains to prove that there may be two Perſons of the ſame Name, and tells me, <hi>it would not have ſtuck with me, if I had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there were two</hi> Artaxerxes, and ſome others he there mentions; and then gravely concludes, <hi>There's no ſtrangeneſs in this;
<note place="margin">P. 12.</note> but that any Man ſhould be ſo ſenſeleſs, to think theſe two Pairs</hi> (he mentions) <hi>were but one Man each,</hi> — Now I grant our Author, that it is <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> to think that two Perſons may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40132:25"/>not have the ſame Name; but withall it is a little <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> too to pretend to anſwer an Objection, and yet never conſider that wherein it conſiſts. There might be two <hi>Sanballats,</hi> as well as two <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> (tho' not ſo eaſie nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it was as our Author would have it, of two ſuch differing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Originals as <hi>Chutha</hi> and <hi>Moab;</hi>) but that each of theſe <hi>Sanballats</hi> ſhould be a Lieutenant in the ſame Country, that each of them ſhould have a Daughter, that each of theſe Daughters ſhould be married to a Son of the High Prieſt, againſt the Laws of their Countrey, that each of theſe Sons ſhould be obſtinate, and perſiſt in ſuch unlawfull Wedlock, and for which each of them was deprived of his Prieſthood, and of all Honour in his own Countrey: And with our Author's good leave, theſe I ſuppoſe are not Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch ordinary Occurrence, as having two Men of the ſame Name; and for my part I can liken it to nothing elſe than as I have already, to the <hi>Platonick</hi> Year. And ſuch a Conjunction of all Circumſtances is likely to fall out, when the <hi>Platonick</hi> Revolution ſhall have ſet every thing in the ſame Order, Place, and Station as it was before.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Our Author comes to conſider the Age of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> Brother of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and here he ſaith, <hi>The Objector, to find a Fault in this Story, makes many. For firſt he confounds this Brother of</hi> Jaddus <hi>with his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by</hi> Nehemiah <hi>in the end of his Book,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 13.28.</note> Nehemiah <hi>there calleth him,</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Joiada,</hi> the Son of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> the High Prieſt; <hi>which is plain enough to ſhew, that he was younger Brother of</hi> Johanan, <hi>the Father of</hi> Jaddus. Now I own that I take <hi>Manaſſes</hi> to be the ſame that is mentioned by <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> I own likewiſe that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> does not call him the Brother of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> but <hi>one of the Sons of</hi> Joiada: But has our Author forgot what he ſays about the <hi>common way of ſhortening Pedigrees</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Ezra?</hi>

               <note place="margin">Neh. 12.23.</note> who indeed was his Grandfather, and his immediate Father was <hi>Joiada:</hi> And why, I wonder, will not this ſerve in the preſent Caſe, and when it is ſaid <hi>one of the Sons of</hi> Joiada, it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that he was his <hi>Grandſon,</hi> and not his immediate Son, as is very uſual, both in this Book, and in other places of Scripture, (as our Author has obſerved, though I think not ſo pertinently applied to the Caſe of <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> for the Reaſons before.) But notwithſtanding this Anſwer of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf, he tells me very magiſterially, <hi>No matter for that, the Objector to make</hi> Joſephus <hi>a Lyar, makes bold with the Scripture it ſelf.</hi> And what is this <hi>Boldneſs,</hi> I pray? Why truly, ſuppoſing that when the Scripture calls ſuch a Perſon the Son of another, he may be the Grandſon, and not the Son in propriety of Speech. And if this be to <hi>make bold</hi> with Scripture, 'tis what is very allowable; and our Author hath the leaſt reaſon to charge me with it, who uſes the very ſame <hi>boldneſs,</hi> and inſiſts upon it, and intimates me guilty of Inconſiderateneſs for not minding it. This therefore is a plain
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40132:25"/>Anſwer to what our Author here cites out of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and he that is call'd one of the Sons of <hi>Joiada,</hi> might notwithſtanding be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Son of <hi>Johanan; i. e.</hi> he might be <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions. And as there is no reaſon, ſo our Author being conſiſtent with himſelf, can never except againſt it. But I have one thing more to obſerve, and that is,</p>
            <p>That there is all the Reaſon in the World to conclude, even from <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> himſelf, that he who is mentioned in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as marrying the Daughter of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> could be no other than <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> though at the ſame time it will appear, that he hath miſplaced them, as to the time of it.
<note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> Now <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Eleventh Book of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> undertakes to give account of the Affairs of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 7.</note> during the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, and among other obſervable things, he particularly takes notice of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and of matters relating to the time of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but not one ſingle word either of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> or of any Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the High Prieſt's Son or Grandſon with his Daughter, or of any ſuch Marriage at all. He likewiſe particularly takes notice of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Joiada,</hi> of his Friendſhip with <hi>Bagoſes,</hi> and by whoſe aſſiſtance he hoped to gain the High Prieſthood; and laſtly of his Death, being killed by his elder Brother <hi>Johanan</hi> in the Temple; but not the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of his Marrying with the Daughter of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> nor any thing like it: And all that <hi>Joſephus</hi> does mention, with reſpect to that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is, That <hi>Sanballat</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> and ſent by <hi>Darius,</hi> who was conquered by <hi>Alexander;</hi> and that <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> married his Daughter, and for which he was expelled by <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> From whence 'tis very plain.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That there is not the leaſt Foot-ſtep in <hi>Joſephus</hi> for two <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat</hi>'s being Prefects of <hi>Syria,</hi> at two differing times.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>Joſephus</hi> takes no manner of notice of two Marriages of the High Prieſt's Son with the Daughter of a Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> but onely of one.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That this one is the Marriage of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> to the Daughter of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) As to the Matter the Scripture account and <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s perfectly agree, <hi>Joſephus</hi> indeed hath added the Name of the Man, <hi>(Manaſſes,)</hi> and of the Woman, <hi>(Nicaſo,)</hi> in which the Scripture is ſilent.</p>
            <p>And therefore I will appeal to any unprejudiced and impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether, fairly laying things together, he can poſſibly believe, that this account in <hi>Joſephus</hi> was not deſigned for the ſame account we have in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> onely he hath miſtimed it; for <hi>Joſephus</hi> all along giving us the account of Scripture, (and which he himſelf intimates,) if there were two <hi>Sanballats,</hi> why did he not name them? If two ſuch Marriages,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40132:26"/>how came he to omit them? But if there was but onely one, (and he muſt have good Eyes that can find any more in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> then it is plain that <hi>Joſephus</hi> is miſtaken, and the Queſtion is, whether the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is to regulate <hi>Joſephus,</hi> or <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account to regulate the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which will require no difficulty to determine.</p>
            <p>Our Author adds,
<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> 
               <hi>But</hi> Joſephus <hi>knew what he writ, as appears by his fixing the time of this Story. There was no date of Time better known among the</hi> Jews, <hi>than that of the Building their Temple at</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>nor among the</hi> Samaritanes, <hi>than that of the Building the Temple of</hi> Girizim. <hi>They remembred nothing more than the Deſtruction of their Temples; and no doubt if they had any Records, or any Hiſtories, the times of theſe things were chiefly remembred in them: But it was within</hi> 200 <hi>years of</hi> Joſephus<hi>'s time that the Temple at Mount</hi> Girizim <hi>was deſtroyed by</hi> Johannes Hircanus, <hi>it happened at a memorable time, ſoon after the Death of</hi> Antiochus Pius, <hi>(which was in the year before Chriſt</hi> 130,)
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> 
               <hi>then that Temple was deſtroyed, ſaith</hi> Joſephus, 200 <hi>years after the building of it. How long that Temple ſtood none knew better than the</hi> Samaritanes <hi>themſelves. And as they were Enemies to the</hi> Jews, <hi>ſo they muſt be particularly to that</hi> Author, <hi>who provokes them as oft as he mentioneth them; How then durſt he have put it into their power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him? I take it therefore for certain, by their account as well as his, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting</hi> 200 <hi>years upwards from the Deſtruction,) that their Temple was built in the year before Chriſt</hi> 430, (it ſhould be 330,) <hi>which falls in the time of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great; and not as the Objector would have it, in the time of</hi> Artaxerxes Longimanus.</p>
            <p>But, 1. Where does our Authour find, that <hi>I would have it,</hi> that the Temple of <hi>Girizim</hi> was <hi>built in the time of</hi> Longimanus? I ſay no ſuch thing, nor was there any need of it. I quote indeed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers, who affirm it was built long before the times of <hi>Alexander;</hi> but I do but barely quote it, and draw no Argument from it; or if I had, it would not follow, that therefore I would have it built in the time of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> nor does it follow from any thing I ſay; for ſuppoſe <hi>Sanballat</hi> built the Temple for his Son-in-law, that might very well be, and it could not reaſonably be otherwiſe than ſeveral years after <hi>Longimanus.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Author tells us, <hi>Joſephus</hi> fixes this Story at a time <hi>well known,</hi> as the Building the Temple, <hi>no date of time better</hi> known among the <hi>Jews than the building the Temple at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>nor among the</hi> Samaritanes, <hi>than the building the Temple of</hi> Girizim. But I pray was not likewiſe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and building the Walls of it, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with Inhabitants, a date of time alſo well known? And <hi>no doubt</hi> (as our Author argues) <hi>if they had any Records, or any Hiſtories, the times of theſe things were chiefly remembred in them.</hi> But for all that <hi>Joſephus</hi> fixes the time of that in the Reign of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which is contrary to our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40132:26"/>Author's own account, who fixes it in the Reign of his Succeſſour: So that for any thing I can ſee, the date of time well known, is no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt Errour and Miſtake; and I ſuppoſe there was as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for <hi>Joſephus</hi> to know the date of the Building the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as of a Temple in <hi>Samaria.</hi> But this concerned the Affairs of his own Countrey, in which there was no need to be ſo exact; for his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Friends would not be ſo ready to find fault: For our Author tells us, <hi>the</hi> Samaritanes <hi>were Enemies to the</hi> Jews, <hi>and particularly to</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus; <hi>and how</hi> durſt <hi>he put it in their power to diſprove him.</hi> As if a Man who <hi>durſt</hi> miſtake in the Affairs of his own Countrey, <hi>durſt</hi> not alſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in thoſe of his Neighbours; there is reaſon indeed that a Man ſhould not tell that for truth which is not; but if Men are miſtaken, and take one thing or time for another, I think there is no need to prove that Men are not affraid to publiſh theſe Miſtakes, let them concern ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend or Foe. But our Author confirms his Point, <hi>The</hi> Samaritans <hi>would certainly diſprove him, if this had not been true; and therefore I take it for certain by their account, as well as his.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) How does our Author know whether they did diſprove him or no, has he any <hi>Samaritane</hi> Authors that wrote about thoſe Times? And methinks he that will not admit the <hi>Silence</hi> of <hi>Heathen</hi> Hiſtorians to be a Proof concerning a Matter that mightily related to their Hiſtory, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not himſelf conclude from the Silence of <hi>Samaritane</hi> Writers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when there are no ſuch Writers to be found.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Diſpute between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes</hi> was not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the building or deſtroying their Temple, but concerning their Worſhip, or the Place of it, but not the Structure; and it made no manner of difference as to that, whether their Temple was built at the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or 100 years before.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells a Story of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> concerning their Worſhip, and which came to be debated before <hi>Ptolomy</hi> by Advocates on each ſide; and he that undertook the Cauſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> proved the Holineſs of the Temple from the Law; and by a continued Succeſſion of High Prieſts, and the propagation of the Prieſthood to that very time, and the Honours and Gifts conferred on that Temple by the Kings of <hi>Aſia;</hi> but not a word which of the Temples was firſt built, or inſiſting upon the late building of the Temple of <hi>Girizim.</hi> So that it ſeems let that be ſooner or later, it made no difference in the Queſtion. And it is plain enough the Diſpute and Schiſm laſted after the Temple of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim</hi> was deſtroyed, nay, after both the Temples were deſtroyed; it was not therefore either the Building or the Deſtruction of the Temple was matter of Diſpute between them: And ſo with reſpect to the time of that, (which is the Matter now before us,) if our Author could find they had not diſproved <hi>Joſephus</hi> in that, it would not ſignifie much,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40132:27"/>there being no great need to be ſo very critical in that which was not the main point in Controverſie, and whether it was built or deſtroyed 100 years before or after, it was all one in reſpect of that; nay, if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor could find that they had diſproved <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this, it would have ſignified nothing neither; for our Author hath a ſmall Argument that would wipe out the Teſtimony of all the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> in the World; for who knows not that the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> hated the <hi>Jews,</hi> and had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Quarrel againſt <hi>Joſephus,</hi> for talking ſuch hard things of them? And therefore though our Author brings their not diſproving <hi>Joſephus</hi> as an Argument to confirm what he ſays, it is plain enough, that if they had diſproved him a thouſand times over, it would ſignifie nothing at all by our Author's way of arguing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Authour proves the Temple of <hi>Girizim</hi> muſt be built in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by calculating from the Deſtruction of it, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> was 200 <hi>years after the building of it;</hi> and that being ſoon after <hi>Antiochus Pius</hi>'s Death, which was 130 years before Chriſt, reckoning upwards, the Building of it will fall in 330 before Chriſt, which is the time of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Suppoſe it: What is that to the Controverſie between us, which is not concerning the Building of that Temple, but the Age of <hi>Sanballat?</hi> I have no Diſpute with him about that; let it be built when he pleaſes, it is all one to me; but if he will needs have <hi>Sanballat</hi> to build it, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> affirms, I doubt it muſt be built before <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Suppoſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays this; why then this proves, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this point is conſiſtent with himſelf; but this does not prove but that he may be out in his Account, which is the onely Queſtion, from the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Death of <hi>Antiochus Pius,</hi> is ſuppoſe 200 years, and ſo far <hi>Joſephus</hi> reckons right; but if the ground of this Calculation be wrong, how equally ſoever he may reckon from thence, the whole is a Miſtake. He had placed the building of this Temple in the Time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſpeaking of the Deſtruction of it 200 years after, he could not, without contradicting himſelf, ſay otherwiſe. And the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that this proves is, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> did not contradict himſelf. <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> in the ſame place ſaith, it was built <hi>by the Permiſſion of</hi> Alexander, and refers to what he had ſaid of it before, and it is every jot as good an Argument to prove the Temple was built <hi>by the Permiſſion of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe he mentions it again in another place of the ſame Book. This proves indeed that <hi>Joſephus</hi> did not forget himſelf; but proves the Point no more than if he had ſaid it onely once: For the ſecond Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of no more Validity and Authority than the firſt, and eſpecially when the firſt is plainly and particularly referred to; as if <hi>Joſephus</hi> his Authority concerning the ſame thing, was more cogent in his <hi>Thirteenth</hi> than it is in his <hi>Eleventh</hi> Book.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40132:27"/>
            <p> With reſpect to this matter, our Author adds,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>He tells us from</hi> David Ganz, <hi>that the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Chronologers affirm, that the Temple on Mount</hi> Girizim <hi>was built long before the time of</hi> Alexander, <hi>and that at the time of</hi> Alexander, Simeon Juſtus <hi>was High Prieſt, and which</hi> Simeon <hi>was Grand-ſon of</hi> Jaddus. And to this our Author adds out of the next Page, <hi>The Objector tells us afterwards that</hi> Calviſius, <hi>and not only he, but all Chronologers find</hi> Joſephus<hi>'s Errors and Miſtakes concerning thoſe times, ſo many and ſo groſs, as would make any man that acted upon Principles of Sincerity very fearful to uſe an Example taken out of him in matters of Practice.</hi> Now I do not know for what purpoſe our Author added this laſt Citation here (for it does not concern the immediate matter our Author argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, nor was it uſed by me with reference either to the building of the Temple of <hi>Girizim,</hi> or to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers, but a general Inference from the whole,) except it was for an Introduction to the Reflection that follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I believe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Objector</hi> acts upon Principles of Sincerity <hi>in other things, notwithſtanding that he ſeems to forget them in his Quotations:
<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> In theſe I muſt needs ſay, he gives great ſuſpicion of the contrary, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe words that make againſt him in his own Authors. Of which I ſhall give a clear proof by and by.</hi> And when our Author does give that, we ſhall ſee whether there is from thence any reaſon for ſuch <hi>great ſuſpicion of my Sincerity in my Quotations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What our Author adds, about excepting <hi>all the beſt of Chronologers</hi> from among thoſe who find fault with <hi>Joſephus,</hi> I ſhall conſider preſently, in the mean time with reſpect to the Citation out of <hi>Ganz</hi> he tells us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I allow him the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Chronologers, who are as much the Enemies of</hi> Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus <hi>as he himſelf, for they have the like quarrel againſt him, becauſe he breaks all their meaſures.</hi> Well, I perceive, tho <hi>Joſephus</hi> was ſomewhat unfortunate, in having ſo many people find fault with him, yet he is mighty happy in an Advocate, who will be ſure to find out ſome oblique reaſon or other, to lay all the blame upon them. But I wonder which way our Author will <hi>vindicate Joſephus</hi> from himſelf; ſuch Characters may ſerve well enough for <hi>Heathens, Jews,</hi> and the Anſwerer; and <hi>Malice, Enmity,</hi> and <hi>particular Quarrels,</hi> may be a reaſon ſufficient againſt them. But what I pray is the Reaſon of the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> Contradicting of <hi>Joſephus: Joſephus</hi> as much <hi>breaks our Authors Meaſures</hi> as mine, and if he can reconcile his own Chronology with <hi>Joſephus,</hi> I will give him the Cauſe. And let our Author try what a pure Anſwer this would be, in the differing Account he gives from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and I do not know any reaſon, but it may be as good an Anſwer for him, with reſpect to the points in which he differs from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as it is for me, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe, in which I differ from him.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40132:28"/>
            <p> Well! how liberal ſoever the Author was but juſt before to <hi>allow</hi> me the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers, becauſe he thinks them not worth much; yet for all that he will not <hi>allow</hi> me <hi>them</hi> neither: for it follows, <hi>But yet the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Chronologers will not help the Objector in his Cauſe. They will not make</hi> Jaddus <hi>live to one hundred and twenty four years of age, and</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat <hi>to one hundred and forty five.</hi> Nor did I quote them for any ſuch thing, but for ſomething elſe as we ſhall ſee preſently. In the mean time his Reaſon is, <hi>They are ſo far from that, that they ſcarce allow either of them any age, for they make the

               <hi>Ganz</hi> himſelf in anſwering an Objection out of <hi>Meor Enajim</hi> concerning this very matter, and to make good his Compute, ſuppoſes the High Prieſts to have Children at eighteen or twenty, and then ſuppoſes that upon the Return out of <hi>Babylon, Jeſhua</hi> might be a hundred, at the ſame time <hi>Joakim</hi> eighty, <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Joiadah</hi> forty, <hi>Johanan</hi> twenty, and <hi>Jadduah</hi> juſt born then; and then concludes, if <hi>Simeon Juſtus</hi> were <hi>Jaddua</hi> he muſt be thirty five, at the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> if <hi>Simeon Juſtus</hi> was the eighth from <hi>Jeſhua, (i. e.)</hi> the Grandſon of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> then it is but ſuppoſing they had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at eighteen, and then there would be time ſufficient. Now this how wild ſoever it be, yet ſhews that they were not for allowing them ſcarce any age, when <hi>Ganz</hi> himſelf hath taken ſuch mighty pains to <hi>make</hi> them ſome: and, as I take it, the aſſigning <hi>Jaddus</hi> expreſly thirty five years at the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> is not <hi>ſcarcely allowing him any age.</hi> And this by the way is in the very Page that our Author quotes, <hi>viz. pag.</hi> 64. Our Author adds, <hi>In that ſixth year of</hi> Alexander, <hi>they ſay that he came up againſt</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and that</hi> Jaddus (Ganz <hi>ſays</hi> Simeon Juſtus) <hi>the High Prieſt, and all the Elders of</hi> Iſrael <hi>came forth to him, and that they made a Covenant with</hi> Alexander (<hi>tho</hi> Darius <hi>was then living.</hi>) And yet <hi>Ganz</hi> has not the leaſt ſyllable of Darius <hi>being then living.</hi> But as it happens, the very Page before, and but five Lines before he ſpeaks of <hi>Simeon Juſtus,</hi>

<note place="margin">Pag. 57.</note> for theſe are his next Words: <hi>This Story</hi> (ſays he) <hi>fills up moſt of that very Page our Objector quotes in his Margent.</hi> Well, that is true; but there is this difference, that the High Prieſt there is called <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Juſtus,</hi> and our Author calls him <hi>Jaddus,</hi> but for that our Author ſays, <hi>he might have ſeen in the paſſage before, where</hi> Ganz <hi>tell us of</hi> Simeon the Juſt, <hi>that his name was</hi> Jadduah. And that is true too, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40132:28"/>he ſays ſo; and this brings us to the point before us. <hi>Ganz</hi> makes the whole time of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy very ſhort, about ſixty and odd years: and at the end of it makes <hi>Simeon Juſtus</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſhua</hi> High Prieſt, and calls him <hi>Jadduah,</hi> which is plainly falſe; for <hi>Simeon Juſtus</hi> was Son of <hi>Onias,</hi> and Grandſon of <hi>Jaddus.</hi> And therefore againſt his ſhort Computation, he raiſes an Objection out of other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers, particularly out of the Author of <hi>Meor Enajim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 58, 59.</note> who ſays that <hi>Simeon Juſtus</hi> was the <hi>Eighth</hi> from <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> and proves it partly from <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> 12. where it is ſaid, And <hi>Jeſhua</hi> begat <hi>Joiakim,</hi> and <hi>Joiakim</hi> begat <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> and <hi>Eliaſhib Joiada,</hi> and <hi>Joiada Johanan,</hi> and <hi>Johanan Jaddua:</hi> and partly by Tradition; for it is received, that <hi>Jaddua</hi> begat <hi>Onias,</hi> and <hi>Onias, Simeon Juſtus:</hi> and which is certainly true. And the Conſequence of this is, that the times of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy were much longer than <hi>Ganz</hi> computes them; and which ſeems to be the main reaſon of the Objection as it is repeated by <hi>Ganz:</hi> (for I have not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) and which appears further by <hi>Ganz</hi>'s Anſwer, page 63, 64. And this was the reaſon of my quoting the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers, not for <hi>Ganz</hi>'s Account, which is falſe and ridiculous, but for thoſe other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers which he mentions, and who plainly underſtood the Chronology of thoſe Times much better than he did; the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they give of the Succeſſion of the High Prieſts is undoubtedly true, and what they prove by it, that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy ſtood much longer than <hi>Ganz</hi> would have it, is certainly true likewiſe; but as far as appears by what <hi>Ganz</hi> cites, they thought <hi>Simeon Juſtus</hi> was High Prieſt at the end of that Monarchy as well as <hi>Ganz,</hi> only he calls him <hi>Jaddua,</hi> when <hi>Jaddua</hi> was his Grandfather, and is plainly proved ſo by them from the Succeſſion of the High Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſame account it was that I quoted <hi>Ganz</hi> for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers concerning the building of the Temple of <hi>Girizim, which</hi> our Author tells us,
<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> 
               <hi>The Objector ſaith the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Chronologers affirm to have been built long before</hi> Alexander<hi>'s time.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>his</hi> Ganz <hi>tells us, that ſome of their Writers have ſaid ſo, but he diſproves them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of a certainty, that it was built in</hi> Alexander<hi>'s time, and by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> Very well, then <hi>Some of them have ſaid ſo,</hi> and that is as much as I affirmed; but Ganz <hi>himſelf ſays the contrary,</hi> And what if he does? The other ſay contrary to him, and any Man that conſiders what <hi>Ganz</hi> repeats out of them, will find (as I noted before) that what they ſay comes nearer to truth, and conſequently that they are more conſiderable, and are much to be preferred to him. <hi>Ganz</hi> indeed gives a ſtrange account of theſe matters, but the others do not; and how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Author may laugh at them, it does not appear that they are ſo very trifling and inconſiderable. But let that be as it will, it plainly appears from hence, that this matter even among them is an intricate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40132:29"/>and perplexed thing, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronologers cannot agree about it. And there are the ſame Debates and Diſputes amongſt them, as there are among others. And this is a pure Account to build a Matter of Practice on, which is the Subject of Contention among all ſorts of Chronologers, and hath no manner either of certainty or perſpicuity in it. Our Author adds, <hi>He</hi> (Ganz) <hi>doth indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the two</hi> Sanballats, <hi>the</hi> Chuthaean, <hi>and the</hi> Horonite, <hi>and makes</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes <hi>to be the Prieſt that was depoſed in</hi> Nehemiah<hi>'s time: this might be excuſed in a</hi> Jew. This is a fine Complement to all the Chronologers almoſt that have wrote concerning theſe times; for excepting <hi>Voſſius</hi> and thoſe that follow him, and our Author, as far as I know, all the reſt, even the Primate himſelf (<hi>whoſe Judgment</hi> our Author <hi>attributes much to</hi>) make no ſuch diſtinction either between <hi>Sanballat</hi> or <hi>Manaſſes.</hi> But it ſeems all that our Author has to ſay for them is, what they ſay <hi>might be excuſed in a</hi> Jew, (And what I pray was <hi>Joſephus?) But it is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in them.</hi> Well, but our <hi>Author</hi> has a Reaſon: <hi>That reckons that act of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>but four years before the Reign of</hi> Alexander. A very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Buſineſs, that is to ſay, our Author will excuſe a <hi>Jew,</hi> (and I dare ſay any body elſe) for calling <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s <hi>Sanballat</hi> the ſame with <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>'s, provided he will bring him down low enough to fit our Author's purpoſe. But what is this to our Author's Reaſon, The Difference between <hi>Chutha</hi> and <hi>Horonaim?</hi> for if the Reaſon why they are not the ſame be, becauſe they were of diverſe Countries, that Reaſon is all one whether they were Contemporaries, or lived at an hundred years di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from each other; and therefore I do not know the force of what follows: <hi>But it is not to be allowed one that reckons one hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</hi> And why not, I pray, at leaſt as much as a <hi>Jew,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this matter? for if the difference lie only that the one was a <hi>Heronite,</hi> and the other a <hi>Chuthaean,</hi> the Miſtake is all one with reſpect to that, whether we reckon one, or one hundred years between: he adds, <hi>And takes upon him to correct</hi> Joſephus <hi>by Chriſtian Chronology.</hi> What does our Author mean by this? The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chronology he laughs at, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Chronology is not for the purpoſe. And therefore <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> let him ſay what he pleaſe, is not to be corrected at all; and this, I ſuppoſe, would ſatisfie our Author in this point. But then by what Chronology does our Author <hi>correct</hi> Joſephus? (for he corrects him too.) And if he pleaſe to tell us by what Chronology he does that; it will ſerve my turn well enough, and I will be contented with it. But why <hi>Chriſtian Chronology?</hi> Is Chronology the worſe for being <hi>Chriſtian?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> I am afraid this ſame <hi>Chriſtian Chronology</hi> hath ſome <hi>Enmity</hi> or other with <hi>Joſephus, becauſe he breaks all the meaſures of it.</hi> Or elſe our <hi>Author</hi> would have allowed at leaſt as much <hi>excuſe</hi> for it, as he does to a <hi>Jew.</hi> However, the Chronology that I uſe is the Scripture Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40132:29"/>and if <hi>Joſephus</hi> cannot be reconciled to that, I think, with our Author's leave, that may <hi>correct</hi> Joſephus, let our Author call it <hi>Chriſtian Chronology,</hi> or what he pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing more to be taken notice of, and that is, that our Author tells us, <hi>That this Story</hi> (meaning the Story of <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Alexander) fills up moſt of that very page</hi> (in <hi>Ganz) that our Objector quotes in the Margent.</hi> Now it is true, there is ſomething of the High Prieſt's going out to <hi>Alexander.</hi> But then <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Story and this do ſo much differ, that the <hi>Variety</hi> is one Argument more for the <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of it: <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls the High Prieſt <hi>Jaddus, Ganz, Simeon Juſtus; Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> tells us, that upon his adoring the Name of God, and ſaluting the High Prieſt, the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and the reſt were aſtoniſhed, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought him in his right mind, only <hi>Parmenio</hi> ask'd him, How he that was ador'd by all, ſhould himſelf adore the High Prieſt of the <hi>Jews?</hi> To whom he anſwered, that he did not adore him, but God, whoſe High Prieſt he was. For, ſays he, I ſaw him in this ſame Habit when I was in <hi>Dio</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi> who exhorted me, deliberating how I might ſubdue <hi>Aſia,</hi> to be of good Courage, and forthwith lead out my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for by his Conduct I ſhould gain the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire. But <hi>Ganz</hi> tells us, his Captains and Servants admiring (at his Bowing to the High Prieſt) and indeed being diſpleaſed at it, he ſaid to <hi>them,</hi> That an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, who that night in a Viſion walk'd before him in his Army, was in Figure and Form like to that Man. — <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays the <hi>Jews</hi> asked ſeveral Prvileges and Immunities of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and he granted them. <hi>Ganz</hi> ſays he ask'd of <hi>Simeon Juſtus,</hi> that he would make his Image of Gold, and place it in the Temple between the Steps and the Altar; to which the High Prieſt replyed, that it was forbid them by God, to make any Graven Image, but they would provide for him a better Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>viz.</hi> that all the Sons that were born that year, ſhould be called by his Name, <hi>Alexander.</hi> With which the King was well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>And now I ſuppoſe the great Difference of telling this Story is no great Credit to it.
<note place="margin">P. 245.</note> And it is very remarkable what <hi>Vorſtius</hi> (the Editor of <hi>Ganz</hi>) ſays concerning this very Story. He tells us, that <hi>Joſippus</hi> does not tell this Story of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> the ſame way; for he ſays that <hi>Alexander</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> an Angel with a Sword appeared to him, threatening to kill him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then <hi>Vorſtius</hi> adds,
<note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>But that there is nothing of Truth in this</hi> Fable, <hi>there are many things argue, that I ſay nothing of the profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this matter, in the genuine</hi> Joſephus, Arrian <hi>and</hi> Curtius, <hi>who certainly would never have paſſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40132:30"/>by ſuch a famous Inſtance, when they often take notice of things of far leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The differing Relation of this Story every way ſhews the Vanity of it.</hi> I muſt confeſs that I was much ſurpiſed, when I read of the <hi>profound ſilence of this Story in the genuine</hi> Joſephus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo, I ſuppoſe, will any Man elſe that conſiders the Learning and Care of this Author. But that he did not ſay this inconſiderately, and out of Negligence or Forgetfulneſs, is plain; for in a few Lines after, and in the very next Paragraph, ſpeaking of the Fact of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and the building the Temple in Mount <hi>Girizim</hi> (and the place he refers to, is page 60, 61. concerning <hi>Sanballat</hi> building that Temple by the permiſſion of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and making his Son-in-law <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his High Prieſt, he quotes the very Book and Chapter where theſe things are now in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and plainly ſays, <hi>Flavius (Joſephus) has nothing of theſe things in the eighth Chapter of the eleventh Book of his Antiquities:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nihil de his Flavem in Antiq. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 246.</note> which is the very Book and Chapter where all theſe things are now extant. I am not now at leiſure to read over the whole Book, but I remember ſomewhere he complains of the Corruption of theſe Books of <hi>Joſephus</hi> which are abroad. And if he had another Copy, or ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, in which this Story is not, it would <hi>vindicate Joſephus</hi> much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any thing our Author hath ſaid. And if he had not, it will be very hard (conſidering the Man) to give any tolerable Account of theſe Paſſages. But let that be as it will, his Argument is the ſame, and the ſtronger if it be alſo related in another manner by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine <hi>Joſephus;</hi> for if the Variety and Diſcrepancy in the Relation of a Story be an Argument of the Vanity of it, then the greater <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> ſtill more confirms it. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> relating it yet <hi>differently,</hi> ſtrengthens the Inference, that therefore <hi>it is but a Fable, and hath no Truth in it.</hi> And here it may not be amiſs to add a Remark of a very Learned Author of our own, which comes home to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<note place="margin">2 vol. p. 100.</note> it is Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> who ſpeaking of this very Story, ſays, <hi>The Talmudiſts own the Story, but alter the Name,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>And therefore, as an Addition to this, I ſhall yet give a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtance. And that is, that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> themſelves lay claim to this very Story. It is to be found in <hi>Chronico Samaritano,</hi> brought over by Dr. <hi>Huntington,</hi> and by him given to the Univerſity Library in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and which is very ancient, and ends about the time of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> I give it according to the Tranſlation of the Learned Doctor <hi>Barnard.</hi>

            <p>Our Author having conſidered the <hi>Difficulties</hi> in Chronology, and which he tells us he hath <hi>proved to be none,</hi> (how well let the Reader judge) comes now to conſider, the <hi>ſeveral Inconſiſtences in the Story it ſelf, noted by</hi> Salian. To which our Author anſwers,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Jeſuit <hi>was an Enemy to the very name of</hi> Joſephus <hi>for</hi> Scaliger<hi>'s ſake.</hi> Well! it muſt be confeſſed, that that is a good Anſwer indeed which will ſerve all Purpoſes, Nations, Times and Perſons.

And if this be not enough to ſilence all Men that ſpeak againſt <hi>Joſephus,</hi> or queſtion any thing that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40132:31"/>he ſays, it is a very hard Caſe. But our Author tells us, <hi>He will take the Inconſiſtencies as they lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is, that</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſaith, the</hi> Phenicians <hi>and</hi> Chaldaeans, <hi>who followed</hi> Alexander, <hi>when he came againſt</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thought to have plundered the City. Now, ſaith the Objector, how ſhould he have</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans <hi>in his Army, when as yet he had not taken</hi> Babylon, <hi>nor came near to</hi> Chaldaea.</p>
            <p>He anſwers, <hi>He might have</hi> Chaldaeans <hi>of thoſe whom he had taken at</hi> Iſſus, <hi>many of whom turned over to</hi> Alexander, <hi>and ſerved him, as he told</hi> Darius <hi>in his Epiſtle.</hi> For the proof of this, our Author quotes in the Margent, <hi>Arrian de Exped. Alex.</hi> 2. Now indeed in that Letter <hi>Alexander</hi> tells him, that as many of his ſide who were ſaved at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and fled over to him, he took care of them, and they fought for him willingly. And what then? How many were theſe in all? And how many of them were <hi>Chaldaeans?</hi> Certainly not likely to be ſo many, and to make ſuch a Figure in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army, that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Booty and Plunder ſhould be particularly taken notice of; and therefore this may ſtill go for an <hi>Inconſiſtency.</hi> But our Author does not much trouble himſelf with this, but hath found an <hi>Inconſiſtency,</hi> that the <hi>malicious Salian</hi> himſelf never ſo much thought on, and I dare ſay, no body elſe. And it is this, <hi>I confeſs I know not why theſe</hi> Chaldaeans <hi>ſhould be named together with the</hi> Phoenicians, <hi>as if theſe two Nations ſhould be eager for the Spoils of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>above all the reſt that were in</hi> Alexander<hi>'s Army, there must be ſome Reaſon for this Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in theſe two Nations above others.</hi> And our Author aſſigns two, <hi>probably either their own eſpecial Gain, or for ſome National Spite againſt the</hi> Jews. (Now I always expected that <hi>Spite</hi> and Malice muſt be one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.) And accordingly he tells, <hi>That for the</hi> Phoenicians <hi>the firſt of the Reaſons is plain, becauſe they had the chief Sea Ports, and the Trade of that part of the World: therefore</hi> Tyrus <hi>ſaid of old, Aha! ſhe is broken, I ſhall be repleniſhed when ſhe is laid waſte.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 26.2.</note> And the ſame hope they might have now again.</hi> Yes by all means, when <hi>Tyre</hi> it ſelf was laid waſte, and deſolate but juſt before. <hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>no other Nation could be ſo intent upon the Spoils of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>but only for ſpite. And that was not to be imagined in the</hi> Chaldaeans, <hi>who after ſo long acquaintance as they had with the</hi> Jews <hi>in their Captivity, were kinder to them than any other People, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo ever ſince.</hi> Well, this is ſomething however, I am glad to hear, the <hi>Heathens</hi> have had, and ſtill continue ſo much <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> I hope hereafter their <hi>Hatred</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> will not paſs for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Omiſſion or Silence of any thing that concerns them. But why I pray <hi>could no other Nation be intent upon the Spoils of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>but</hi> only <hi>for</hi> Spite? Methinks, a little <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> or a <hi>Thirſt</hi> after <hi>Prey</hi> (a ſmall Military Virtue) might have gone for a Reaſon, it is very pleaſant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40132:31"/>to aſcribe a Soldier's deſire of Plunder to particular <hi>Spite.</hi> But for all that our Author tells us, <hi>Of all the Nations that were in</hi> Alexander<hi>'s Army, none in the World ſo likely as the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>and of them</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſays there were eight thouſand ſent by</hi> Sanballat; <hi>and when</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſpeaks of theſe people in anger, he commonly calls them</hi> Chuthaei, <hi>which is ſo near a word to</hi> Chaldaei, <hi>that I cannot forbear offering this as an Emendation of the Text; for</hi> ΧΑΛΔΑΙΩΝ <hi>write</hi> ΧΟΥΘΑΙΩΝ. <hi>And then there is no Inconſiſtency,</hi> No truly, nor is there any Inconſiſtency whether we write ſo or no; for covetous and hungry Soldiers to be eager after the Spoils of a City full of Riches and Plenty is a great <hi>Inconſistency</hi> indeed, and for to ſolve which, there is wonderful need to mend the Text. But our Author tells us he could <hi>not forbear</hi> to offer this as an <hi>Emendation,</hi> and for to bring that in, I ſuppoſe, he could <hi>not forbear</hi> making ſuch an <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> as was never heard of before. And it is a Queſtion, whether he found out the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> for the ſake of the <hi>Emendation,</hi> or <hi>mended the Text</hi> for the ſake of the <hi>Inconſiſtency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing</hi> (he ſays) <hi>might very well have been ſpared;
<note place="margin">P. 16.</note> for there is no Inconſiſtency in it, that the</hi> Jews, <hi>when they had found favour with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, ſhould ask the like favour for their Brethren that were in</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>and</hi> Media. The Reaſon of this Inconſiſtency is, for that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> at that time had not conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor <hi>Media,</hi> nor ſo much as been at them. Our Author anſwers: <hi>Theſe Countries, tho</hi> Alexander <hi>had not yet conquered, yet it could not be doubted they would be ſhortly in his Hands.</hi> I ſuppoſe becauſe the Events of War are ſo abſolutely certain, that 'tis eaſie for any Man to know them. And there is no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency at all for Men unconditionally to ask, and another uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally to promiſe, which is not in his power, and which depends upon a future Contingency. <hi>Darius</hi> was not in ſo deſpicable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,, but had not only the greateſt part of his Empire in his Hands, but an Army to back him, and which in number was ſuperior to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>'s. And neither <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, nor the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor any Man elſe (humanly ſpeaking) could be certain of the <hi>Victory;</hi> and for People to ask, and a Prince to grant Liberties and Immunities to the Inhabitants of a Countrey, which is to be fought for, is indeed but ſuch an Inconſiſtency as to divide the Spoils before the Battel is fought. Which, it ſeems, is nothing at all with our Author; for he adds, <hi>They are much to ſeek for faults, that can find them in ſuch a clear Paſſage as this.</hi> And truly they are <hi>much to ſeek for</hi> Anſwers, that can <hi>find no better</hi> to reconcile them. However, our Author adds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuch another is that which next follows,
<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> that the Army was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd to ſee</hi> Alexander <hi>to worſhip</hi> Jaddus. <hi>Well they might, tho it was but a Civil Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. But our Author knowing the Force of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection did not lie in that, adds,</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40132:32"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>But the fault is, that</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſhould put it into</hi> Parmenio<hi>'s mouth to ask</hi> Alexander, <hi>wherefore he ſhould adore another, that was himſelf adored by all. It is adjudged by</hi> Salian <hi>and the Objector an Inconſiſtency, to ſay that</hi> Alexander <hi>was adored, or that he believed himſelf the Son of</hi> Jupiter <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming into</hi> Aegypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Summ of the Anſwer is: <hi>That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration was paid to Eaſtern Princes that did not believe themſelves the Sons of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>that this was not confin'd to Crown'd Heads; for</hi> Joſephus <hi>tells us of</hi> Haman <hi>the King's Favourite,
<note place="margin">Antiq. l. xi. 6.</note> that he had adoration paid him, that the Mother of</hi> Darius <hi>received</hi> Alexander <hi>with this Ceremony, only ſhe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook,
<note place="margin">Plut. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.</note> and paid it to</hi> Epheſtion. <hi>And it is not ſaid, that he refuſed to be treated with that Ceremony.</hi> And the Concluſion is, <hi>That he did ſuffer himſelf to be adored, even before his going into</hi> Aegypt: <hi>And therefore what</hi> Joſephus <hi>tells us of</hi> Parmenio's <hi>ſaying theſe words, might be true, for ought we know, however he might have ſaid them without any</hi> Inconſiſtency. In anſwer to this, I ſhall grant our Author, That <hi>Adoration</hi> was paid to the Eaſtern Princes, and in particular to the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Author will grant, that it was not the Cuſtom to pay Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Weſtern Princes, nor in particular to the Kings of <hi>Macedon.</hi> And ſuppoſe that <hi>Darius</hi>'s Mother, and the <hi>Perſian</hi> Captives, treated <hi>Alexander</hi> with the ſame Ceremony they did the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, what is that to <hi>all,</hi> or to Adoration in general, being paid to him. For it is plain, that <hi>Alexander</hi> had not then taken up the <hi>Perſians</hi> Manners and Cuſtoms, and 'tis as plain, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> mortally hated not only thoſe Cuſtoms, but this in particular. And when a long time after <hi>Alexander</hi> inſiſted on it, they could never be brought to pay it him.
<note place="margin">Arlan. l. 4. Curtius l. 8.</note> And we have a memorable Inſtance of this recorded by <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Curtius,</hi> when ſome time after the death of <hi>Darius, Alexander</hi> had a mind to be ador'd, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, and the better to draw the <hi>Grecians</hi> to it, he laid a Deſign, and made an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for that purpoſe, to which among others, the Princes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> were called. And as the Hiſtorian tells us, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Sophiſters, and the great Men of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> and <hi>Media</hi> that were about <hi>Alexander,</hi> that whilſt they were at their Cups, a Diſcourſe of this Matter ſhould purpoſely be ſet on foot, and accordingly <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> makes a ſet Speech about it; and thoſe that were privy to the Secret, commended it; but the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> diſproving it, held their peace, till at length <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> with a grave and ſharp Speech refutes it, which indeed nettled <hi>Alexander,</hi> but was very grateful to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And when afterwards it came to action, and when <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſent ſome to mind them of what was expected from them, the <hi>Perſians</hi> every one in their order adored him; but for the <hi>Greeks, Leona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> mock'd them, and none of the reſt could be prevailed upon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. And now it is not very likely, that ſuch a Saying ſhould come
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40132:32"/>out of a <hi>Macedonian</hi>'s Mouth, and <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who perfectly hated it, ſhould tell <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was <hi>adored</hi> by all. Beſides (and upon which the Objection turns) it is evident enough, that <hi>Alexander</hi> never required it, till ſome years after the time of aſſigning this Story. And among all Hiſtorians it is reckoned as a great Inſtance of the Corruption of his Virtue, and which was moſt ungrateful to his Countreymen. And it is very conſiſtent indeed, for an Officer to tell his Prince that he was <hi>adored by all,</hi> when he was not adored by the greateſt part, perhaps by none at all of his whole Army, and which was very odious to them, and as far as appears, never ſo much as thought of by the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And therefore altho ſome of the <hi>Perſians</hi> might treat him with the ſame Ceremony they did their own Kings; yet it is plain enough, that he did not receive it, at leaſt not generally; for if he had there is all the reaſon in the world to believe, that it would have been as ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Army, and bred him as much miſchief as it did afterwards, nay rather more, in that he ſhould ſo early aſſume the <hi>Perſian Cuſtoms,</hi> and eſpecially, which they abominated moſt of all, to be <hi>adored</hi> or ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>proſtration.</hi> And I will leave it to any Man who knows the Story, whether it be poſſible for him to believe it. And therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what our Author hath ſaid, here is a double <hi>Inconſiſtency.</hi> (1.) That it was ſaid by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who hated the thing. And (2.) That it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſaid at all.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe <hi>Inconſiſtencies,</hi> I ſhall crave our Author's leave to add three more, and which in my opinion, are more conſiderable than thoſe noted by <hi>Salian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that upon ſeeing the High Prieſt in ſuch Veſtments, <hi>Alexander</hi> told <hi>Parmenio,</hi> that he did not adore the High Prieſt, but <hi>God:</hi> For, ſays he, I ſaw him before in this ſame Habit, when I was at <hi>Dio,</hi> who, when I was deliberating how to ſubdue <hi>Aſia,</hi> exhorted me to be of good Courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for by his Conduct and Guidance, I ſhould obtain the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire. Wherefore, ſo ſoon as I ſaw this Habit, and being mindful of the Viſion, which moved me to this Expedition, I believe I did not lead my Army againſt <hi>Darius</hi> without God, and that I ſhall have the Victory according to my deſire. And afterwards <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſaith, that he went up into the Temple, and ſacrificed to God, according to the Prieſts Direction. And further, ſhewing him the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein it is propheſied, That one of <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould vanquiſh the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which he interpreted to be himſelf. He being overjoyed, diſmiſſed the Multitude. This is the State of this Matter in <hi>Joſephus.</hi> And now let us ſee whether <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Practice be not as direct a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to this as is poſſible. Now the time <hi>Joſephus</hi> faſtens this Story, is after the Siege of <hi>Gaza;</hi> and it is plain, that ſoon after <hi>Alexander</hi> went by tedious and dangerous Marches over Sands and Deſarts to the Oracle
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40132:33"/>of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Curtius l. 4.</note> and there own'd himſelf to be his Son, conſulted the Oracle whether he ſhould be Governor of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now put theſe together, at <hi>Jeruſalem Alexander</hi> meets with a miraculous Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and which wonderfully affects him. And from thence (and if it were true, there was all the reaſon in the World for it) concludes, that the God of the <hi>Jews</hi> moved him to the Expedition, and that under his Conduct he ſhould gain the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, and this further confirm'd by a Prophecy he found there, and yet immediately with a ſtrange eagerneſs to hunt after other Gods, and to expoſe himſelf and his Army to find them, and ſo ſoon as he comes there to own himſelf a Son, and to put himſelf under their Conduct. This, I think, (all things conſidered) is as unaccountable as any thing in the whole Story. And that which yet further confirms it, is that upon his return from the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arrian l. 3.</note> when he came back to <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> and there again ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to <hi>Hercules,</hi> that he ſhould not make one ſtep to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and repeat his Sacrifice to that God whom he own'd (and if the Story be true, it is impoſſible he ſhould do otherwiſe) to be the Mover, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Conduct he expected the Succeſs of his Expedition. And I believe any Man, that fairly conſiders all Circumſtances, will find it very difficult to give any equal Account of this, and eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Temper of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who, whatever his Religion was, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Empire and Victory well enough, as not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nting in any thing that he thought might conduce thereto. And thoſe aſtoniſhing Circumſtances at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (if true) muſt have made a mighty Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his mind, and the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would have been much more in his thoughts than either that of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or of <hi>Hercules</hi> at <hi>Tyre.</hi> And he that ſpent ſo many days through a ſandy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart to the Oracle of <hi>Hammon,</hi> would not have neglected <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon his return, nor have omitted to ſacrifice there, when he was diligent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it to <hi>Hercules</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> tho he had ſacrificed to him likewiſe when he was there before. And the truth is, the Account of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Samaritan Chronicle</hi> (before mentioned) is far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent than the Account in <hi>Joſephus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann. Chriſt.</hi> 330. <hi>Mun.</hi> 4095.</note> for there it is ſaid expreſly among other things, <hi>that</hi> Alexander <hi>returning from</hi> Aegypt <hi>through</hi> Samaria, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped God on Mount</hi> Girizim.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> is, That <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that the Temple on Mount <hi>Girizim</hi> was built by <hi>Sanballat,</hi> by leave obtained from <hi>Alexander.</hi> Now as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays <hi>Sanballat</hi> revolted to <hi>Alexander,</hi> upon his beginning the Siege of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which was ſo grateful to him, that he bid him ask what he would, and he asks him to build this Temple. Now according to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the Siege of <hi>Tyre</hi> laſted ſeven Months, and the Siege of <hi>Gaza</hi> two Months, in all nine Months; and from thence <hi>Alexander</hi> comes to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now in this ſame Chapter <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:40132:33"/>met <hi>Alexander</hi> almoſt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon his going from thence, and taking the Soldiers of <hi>Sanballat</hi> with them, beſought him that he would viſit their City, and honour their <hi>Temple</hi> with his preſence. Then it ſeems their <hi>Temple</hi> was built when <hi>Alexander</hi> went from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that is to ſay, it was built in nine Months, after leave obtained for the building it. And yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us over and over, that this Temple was built after the manner of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which notwithſtanding all the aſſiſtance and encouragement from the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> was building as many <hi>years.</hi> And I will leave it with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or any Man elſe, to make it credible, that ſuch a Temple could be built in nine Months, eſpecially when <hi>Sanballat</hi> and his Soldiers, were all that time attending in the actual Service of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And this I muſt leave for another <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> till our Author reconcile it. But that which is yet more conſiderable, is</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this <hi>wonderful Viſion</hi> ſhould never be heard of before that Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Time, to do the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuch mighty Service. As <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the Story, <hi>Alexander</hi> had this Viſion at <hi>Dio</hi> ſome years before, when he was but <hi>deliberating</hi> on the <hi>Perſian</hi> Expedition, and which mightily encouraged him to undertake it. And how came <hi>Alexander</hi> to conceal it all this while? This certainly had been very good Doctrine to his Army, and would have done him ſervice, if he could have made them belive it, whether it were true or no. How full are Hiſtories not only of <hi>Heathen,</hi> but even of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, who have <hi>invented</hi> a <hi>Divine Conduct</hi> and <hi>Impulſe,</hi> and induſtriouſly ſpread it abroad, to juſtifie their Cauſe, and to animate their Followers. Alas! a <hi>Little Creeping Manuſcript</hi> (tho never ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh) cannot eſcape the having <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> affixed to it. And I'll warrant you, <hi>Alexander</hi> having ſo fair and juſt an opportunity to magnifie himſelf, and encourage his Soldiers, would lock it up as a Secret, and never make any uſe of it. Let any Man, who conſiders the temper and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and even human nature it ſelf, and the univerſal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Mankind, believe this if he can. The <hi>Viſion,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it, was equally <hi>ſtrange,</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> and of which he had no former Idea, for he could not frame to himſelf any Conception of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſt in his <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Attire, by any thing he had ſeen before. And according to the Story he did not, (for then when he is ſuppoſed actually to have ſeen it, the ſight would not have been ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing and affecting) and ſo conſequently, and eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Heatheniſh Superſtition,</hi> he could not conclude otherwiſe, than that it was from God; and <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that he did ſo: and yet to ſay not one word of it, nor make any advantage of it, is certainly one of the ſtrangeſt things in the world. But inſtead of that we hear no more of it, neither <hi>before,</hi> nor <hi>after;</hi> his ſubſequent Progreſs is as much a ſtranger to it, as his former, and certainly, had he forgot it, (which is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40132:34"/>not very likely) yet when it was revived by ſuch an extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, it would have been no inconſiderable Topick to have hearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf and his Soldiers: and I challenge any Man to believe that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> would have neglected it. But for all that, there is a profound ſilence in this matter, even to the end of his Life, and tho we hear of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the Gods of the Nations, yet there is not one ſingle word of the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor of thoſe <hi>Viſionary</hi> Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and Promiſes of Succeſs. It ſaved the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us) and got them Honour, Privileges and Immunities, and there is the beginning and end of it; but for <hi>Alexander</hi> he made no manner of uſe of it. And in plain Terms, this Story ſeems calculated only for the Meridian of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Service of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which plainly denotes it to be a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fable. And (to ſay no more) ſuch things were but too common among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Age foregoing <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among the <hi>Helleniſts</hi> of thoſe times, as is evident from the Book of <hi>Tobit, Judith,</hi> the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> the Aſſumption of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophecy of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> in <hi>Hermes</hi>'s <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and many more. And what if ſuch a Legendary Tale ſhould paſs traditionally in <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s time, and he take it up, and inſert it in his Hiſtory for a truth, tho it hath no other Foundation than the Figments and Fancies of thoſe <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf gives us no Author for this. And I think this is a better <hi>Vindication</hi> of <hi>Joſephus</hi> than any thing our Author hath ſaid for him.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, this whole Story ſeems like other Fictions, to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on falſe Reaſonings on true Hiſtory, like the Hiſtory of S <hi>George</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> which of an original Truth is made a meer Legend and Romance. There was ſuch a Man as S. <hi>George,</hi> and there were ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as <hi>Sanballat, Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Alexander:</hi> and a little <hi>Helleniſtical</hi> Fancy (of which that Age was full) might eaſily jumble them together, and confound differing times, to frame a Romantick Story, that never had any real being. And what wonder is it, if <hi>Joſephus</hi> took a Story upon truſt which made for the Honour of his Nation, and was already invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Hands? And it is plain enough, that (whatever our Author does) <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf gave no ſuch great credit to it; for in his Book againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> which was purpoſely writ to <hi>vindicate</hi> his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> wherein, with great Pains and Learning he hath endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Antiquity and Honour of his Nation from the Teſtimony of Foreigners. And yet he has not one word of <hi>this</hi> glorious Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which notwithſtanding his Argument and Method directly led him to, and was as fit (at leaſt) for his purpoſe as any thing he hath ſaid, and which he could not reaſonably pretermit without injury to his Cauſe,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſeph. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra. Appion. l.</hi> 1.</note> if he had believed it unexceptionable, and not liable to Objection. He plainly and copiouſly ſpeaks of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40132:34"/>kindneſs to the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and of the great Privileges he granted them, when he placed them there, but not the leaſt intimation of his Acknowledgment and Adoration of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the mighty things he there did for them, which certainly had been a far greater Teſtimony, and more to his purpoſe.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He tells us (upon the ſame deſign) that <hi>Ptolomy Euergetes,</hi> upon the Conqueſt of <hi>Syria,</hi> that <hi>he did not ſacrifice to the</hi> Aegyptian <hi>Gods, but coming to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>he ſacrificed to God according to the Cuſtom of the</hi> Jews. But there is not one word of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>ſacrificing</hi> there, nor the leaſt mention of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Circumſtances which attended it, which notwithſtanding is by many degrees a fairer inſtance to prove the Honour of his Nation, and the Reputation of his Religion, than the bare act of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s ſacrificing. <hi>Joſephus</hi> wanted neither Skill nor Eloquence to amplifie and improve every thing that was for his advantage: and 'tis plain enough to a Man but of an ordinary Talent, how ſuitable this was to his Deſign, and what great Advantages might have been made of it to prove his point. And I ſhall leave it with our <hi>Author,</hi> or any Man elſe, to give any other reaſon of his <hi>total omiſſion and ſilence,</hi> of what was ſo exceedingly cogent and pertinent to his purpoſe, (and eſpecially conſidering his mentioning of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his kindneſs, and the ſacrificing of another Prince at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as inſtances of Honour done to his Nation) but that it was, that (tho he inſerted this Story in his Hiſtory) yet he durſt not inſiſt upon it, when the Matter came to Argument and Diſpute. There is a great Difference between bare <hi>Narratives</hi> and <hi>cloſe Diſputes:</hi> and tho <hi>Joſephus</hi> might take the Story, perhaps as he found it, yet when he came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the matter, he e'en let it ſhift for it ſelf as well as it could, and never ſo much as alledged it, or <hi>vindicated</hi> it. But hath left that Honour to his <hi>Vindicator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to our Author, who after having ſaid, That <hi>his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> to thelaſt Inconſiſtences of <hi>Salian</hi> before-mentioned, <hi>are ſo plain, that he cannot think how it came to paſs, that I did not ſee them,</hi> (and yet I profeſs, as plain as they are, I cannot <hi>ſee</hi> them now, nor, I doubt, the Reader neither) but he gives a Reaſon, <hi>Except</hi> Joſephus <hi>had offended him ſo much, that he was too greedy of Objections againſt him, that he did not regard what might be ſaid in his</hi> Vindication. Now as to <hi>Offence,</hi> I muſt ſay, that neither <hi>Joſephus,</hi> nor our Author have <hi>offended</hi> me; and as to his <hi>Vindication,</hi> I did not before <hi>regard</hi> what our Author would ſay, but it was becauſe I did not know it; but, I hope, by this time, our Author will be ſatified, that I have <hi>regarded</hi> it.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>In this angry Humour, he runs on in the next Page, and there he calls in</hi> Calviſius <hi>to be his Second.</hi> Well! I thought ſuch a Second as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſius</hi> in point of Chronology might have been pretty well; but it ſeems I am miſtaken; for our Author tells us,</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40132:35"/>

               <hi>He could not have found a fitter man to take his part; for he had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of his own againſt</hi> Joſephus <hi>for writing ſuch things, as would not conſiſt with his Chronology.</hi> Once again we have got this univerſal Anſwer, that ſtops all Gaps, and fits all purpoſes; I wonder which way I ſhould find a Man for our <hi>Author</hi>'s turn, I have named to him, <hi>Heathens, Jews, Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet none of them will go down with him: and I know not how to ſatisfie our Author, except I could bring a Man that in all points agreed with <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and where is ſuch an <hi>Author</hi> to be found; For my part I know of none ſuch; and I am ſure the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of <hi>Joſephus</hi> is not ſuch a one, who writes things as <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with <hi>Joſephus</hi> as <hi>Calviſius</hi> himſelf; and ſo for any thing I can ſee our Author's Exception lies againſt all Mankind, and againſt himſelf. And <hi>Salian, Calviſius,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> too, <hi>have a quarrel of their own againſt</hi> Joſephus <hi>for writing ſuch things as would not conſiſt with their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology.</hi> And therefore with our <hi>Author</hi>'s good leave, he is every way <hi>as fit for my turn</hi> as <hi>Calviſius</hi> himſelf. And if it would ſave our Author the trouble of making ſuch hard Reflections on the above-mentioned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I am contented to venture my Argument that follows on our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Account, and difference from <hi>Joſephus.</hi> And I am miſtaken, if it does not as ſtrongly conclude from what our Author himſelf ſays, as from what <hi>Calviſius</hi> ſays, or any other <hi>quarrelſome</hi> Chronologer of them all. And this will appear preſently. In the mean time, with reſpect to <hi>Calviſius,</hi> our Author tells us, <hi>This was</hi> Scaliger<hi>'s Fault, who had cramped that part of</hi> Calviſius<hi>'s Chronology, by beginning</hi> Daniel<hi>'s ſeventy weeks in</hi> Darius Nothus<hi>'s. And in conſequence of that</hi> Nehemiah<hi>'s</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>muſt be</hi> Mnemon, <hi>not</hi> Longimanus, <hi>and the</hi> Darius <hi>he mentions not</hi> Nothus, <hi>but</hi> Codomanus. <hi>And if</hi> Nehemiah <hi>liv'd to</hi> Codomanus<hi>'s time, ſo might his</hi> Sanballat <hi>as well. And then why ſhould not the High Prieſt be</hi> Manaſſes, <hi>the ſame that is mentioned in</hi> Joſephus? <hi>And this both</hi> Scaliger <hi>and</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſius <hi>are for; and the Objector, if he pleaſed, might have quoted them for theſe things.</hi> Right, and I did ſo; and a good part of what concerns the Caſe of <hi>Jaddus</hi> is ſpent in confuting it. And it is very pleaſant for our Author to tell me, I might have <hi>quoted them.</hi> And what follows is of the ſame ſtamp. <hi>But then his Arithmetick would have been of no uſe, for</hi> Sanballat<hi>'s one hundred forty years would have been but eighty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. p. 7.</note> Manaſſes <hi>might have been a young man, and</hi> Jaddus <hi>of middle Age.</hi> Right again, and therefore I particularly examined that Account, and I think plainly ſhewed the miſtake of it. But then what does our Author mean by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, I <hi>might,</hi> if I had pleaſed, have <hi>quoted</hi> them for <hi>theſe things,</hi> when I not only <hi>quoted</hi> them, but ſhewed the miſtake of <hi>theſe very things.</hi> But this is the fruit of disjointing a Diſcourſe, and arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scraps and Parcels, without conſidering either the intire Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or the Coherence. Our Author skipping over two parts of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40132:35"/>Diſcourſe, finds that I had there <hi>quoted Calviſius,</hi> and preſently concludes, I had not <hi>quoted</hi> him before, tho I had but the foregoing Leaf (which perhaps our Author never look'd on) not only particularly mention'd theſe very things, but fully examin'd them, and it takes up almoſt a third part of the whole. Well! But our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, <hi>Thoſe two learned Men were ſo far from ſeeing any difficulty in the Story of</hi> Jaddus, <hi>as</hi> Joſephus <hi>tells it, that they take it for unqueſtionable Hiſtory.</hi> And ſo they do, and that is one reaſon why they are both ſo miſtaken in their Chronology: for they place <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Mnemon</hi> and not <hi>Longimanus,</hi> and particularly object the Age of <hi>Sanballat</hi> to the contrary Opinion, and therefore if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (which is our Authors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as well as mine) went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Longimanus, Sanballat</hi> according to theſe two learned Men, at the time of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s taking of <hi>Tyre,</hi> muſt have been above one hundred forty five years old, <hi>And our Author alſo if he pleaſed might have quoted them for theſe things.</hi> But then our Author asks, <hi>Why then does the Objector bring in</hi> Calviſius <hi>as if he were on his ſide in this Argument?</hi> But he anſwers it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>He will ſay He doth not, here is no mention of</hi> Jaddus. <hi>Very well, but here are hard Cenſures on</hi> Joſephus, <hi>which being brought in in this place tho they do not belong to it, may ſerve as well as if they did: Tho</hi> Calviſius <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them for things wherein</hi> Joſephus <hi>differ'd from him, yet the Reader may apply them to that</hi> Story <hi>wherein he agreed with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here we have an inſtance of our Authors dexterity in turning off an Argument, which I preſume he could not fairly anſwer.
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 11.</note> The place he refers to is a general Inference or Argument, I drawed from the whole. The ſum of which is: <hi>That a Story clogg'd with ſuch Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot be drawn into Argument in reference to Practice;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calv.</hi> p. 148.</note> and to confirm this I quoted <hi>Calviſius,</hi> who gives us this account of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and his Hiſtory of theſe Times. <hi>They that reſt upon the Authority of</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſtand upon a very ſlippery and weak foundation;</hi> and farther adds, <hi>When</hi> Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus <hi>is ſo much out concerning theſe Times, who can</hi> ſafely <hi>give Credit to what he aſſerts.</hi> Theſe are what our Author calls <hi>hard Cenſures.</hi> But the Queſtion is, whether they be true or no; if not, why did not our Author diſprove them? but inſtead of that he calls them <hi>hard,</hi> but neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, nor yet ſo much as mentions them, and yet my Argument is plainly drawn from them. But there was ſome reaſon for this, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had ſaid upon this general Inference would have turned home upon him. And therefore it was far better to run over it with general Reflections, or to obſcure it, than to come cloſe to it, and fairly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. Our <hi>Author</hi> cannot deny but <hi>Joſephus was out</hi> in the Hiſtory of theſe Times, or if he did, his own account confutes him; and then from theſe Premiſſes I would fain know why <hi>Calviſius</hi>'s Concluſion does not follow, <hi>who can</hi> ſafely <hi>rely on what he aſſerts</hi> concerning theſe Times.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40132:36"/>that is to ſay, this Concluſion follows as naturally from our <hi>Author</hi> as from <hi>Calviſius,</hi> tho he does not ſay ſo in ſo many words. And here I ſhall make good my word, and ſhew that our Author fits my turn as well as <hi>Calviſius</hi> or any other Chronologer. For according to our Authors own account contradictory to <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s (as appears before) it is plain, <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>'s Authority is not to be rely'd on concerning the Hiſtory of thoſe Times; And this Story of <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> ſtands purely on the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and in a manner contrary to much better Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. However, if that Authority in matters relating to thoſe Times, be not ſufficient to be rely'd on, then the Story of <hi>Jaddus</hi> ſtanding upon that Authority is not to be rely'd on, nor to be drawn into Argument. And therefore 'tis mere Sophiſtry what our Author ſays with reſpect to <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> (and which he may alſo ſay with reſpect to himſelf) <hi>That</hi> Calviſius <hi>intended them in things wherein</hi> Joſephus <hi>differed from him,</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is general; And if <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Authority is not to be rely'd on in things wherein he differs from <hi>Calviſius</hi> and our Author: I would fain know why his Authority (which is the only Queſtion) is to be rely'd on in things wherein he agrees with them. The Agreement or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with our Author, or with <hi>Calviſius</hi> makes no difference in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> And therefore I conclude from our <hi>Author</hi> as well as from <hi>Calviſius</hi> that the Authority of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the Hiſtory of thoſe Times is not to be rely'd on, and before our Author can diſprove it I doubt he muſt alter his Chronological Scheme; and if he does that, he will be as hard put to it to <hi>Vindicate Joſephus</hi> on the other hand.</p>
            <p>And this is General, and the Inference reaches to what account other Chronologers give of thoſe times, as well as <hi>Calviſius</hi> and our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; for (as far as I know) excepting <hi>Voſſius,</hi> there is not one ſingle Chronologer, or Hiſtorian that agrees with <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his account of thoſe times.
<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> The Author told me before, that <hi>I brought all Chronologers</hi> on my ſide <hi>againſt</hi> Joſephus. But that is his miſtake; I brought them indeed <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Joſephus, which makes my Argument good againſt his Authority. But he tells me, <hi>I ſhould have excepted all the beſt both Antient and Modern, and particularly the excellent Primate;</hi> but by his favour I will neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Primate,</hi> nor any other ſince thoſe times but <hi>Voſſius,</hi> and I am ſure the Primate differs from <hi>Joſephus</hi> as much as <hi>Calviſius</hi> tho not in the ſame inſtances, and I deſire our Author among thoſe many numerous and learned Authors, who have conſider'd the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy and the affairs of the <hi>Jews</hi> contemporary therewith, to name one that agrees with <hi>Joſephus</hi> if he can. Any mortal man that reads the whole account <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives us of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy (if he was not acquainted with other Hiſtories) could not otherwiſe than believe, that from the time of releaſing the Captivity to <hi>Alexander,</hi> there were but five Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> or ſix at the moſt, whereas in truth there were twelve or thirteen.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40132:36"/>I know <hi>Voſſius,</hi> to take off the edg of this, ſays,
<note place="margin">Chronol. ſacra. p. 150.</note> That <hi>Joſephus prudently omitted thoſe Kings of</hi> Perſia <hi>with whom the</hi> Jews <hi>had no matter of concern, for that He wrote the Hiſtory of the</hi> Jews, <hi>not of the</hi> Perſians. Which is a ſtrange Reaſon from ſo learned a man, as if the <hi>Jews</hi> had no concern al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with their Principal and Supreme Governours, upon whom they did immediately depend, and by whoſe Authority all their affairs were manag'd; or as if the very names of their Supreme Governours were not ſufficient matter for Hiſtory; or further, as if, during the Reigns of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral Kings for the ſpace altogether of 130 years, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable in <hi>Judea</hi> and fit for an Hiſtorian to take notice of. It is plain enough therefore, either that <hi>Joſephus</hi> was very negligent in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Hiſtory of thoſe times, or that the Records and memory of them were loſt, and he was left to mere Conjecture and Opinion. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which makes good the Concluſion, that his Authority with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe times is not ſufficient to be rely'd on. And it is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that no man beſides <hi>Voſſius</hi> believes him, or relies upon his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in his account of thoſe times. And I wonder why <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is better in the Story of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> than in other matters relating to thoſe times. Suppoſe a man pretending to write a Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> and to give account of the Original, Antiquities, and affairs of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and coming to conſider the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, ſhould leave out one third part of the Kings, and neither name them, nor anything at all done in their times, and yet write as if he gave the whole Hiſtory. I wonder whether any man would take a ſingle Story relating to thoſe times, only upon <hi>his</hi> Credit, and eſpecially if it was a Caſe of Conſcience, and concern'd Practiſe, which is plainly the Caſe.</p>
            <p>By this time I ſuppoſe our Author may be ſatisfied, that He was a little too haſty in charging me with <hi>Inſinctrity, for not quoting what makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in my own Authors.</hi> For I did not quote theſe Authors for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of this Story, but for the general judgment they give of Joſephus <hi>and his Hiſtory of thoſe times,</hi> and which judgment of theirs is certainly true, and our Author cannot deny it, without denying alſo the foundation of his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> which makes good my Inſerence, what opinion ſoever they might have of that Story. And as our Author ſays (and which he intends for an anſwer) <hi>it will ſerve as well</hi> for that purpoſe; <hi>and tho</hi> Calviſius <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them for things wherein</hi> Joſephus <hi>differs from him, yet the Reader may apply them</hi> (and honeſtly too, for they are as applicable) <hi>to that Story wherein he agreed with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, what does our <hi>Author</hi> ſay to two other famous Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, whom I had mention'd, who do not only give the ſame account of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> but come home to the very Story, and plainly intimate their <hi>ſuſpition</hi> of it, to ſay no more.
<note place="margin">Anſw. page 10.</note> And thoſe are our <hi>Lydiat</hi> and <hi>Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> whoſe words I had at large recited, and becauſe our Author will not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40132:37"/>take any notice of them,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Emend.

<note place="margin">Demonſtr. Chronol. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 232.</note> And <hi>Johannes Temporarius</hi> is yet more full. And after having prov'd the Inconſiſtency by Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy ſays—It is neceſſary that the <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Jaddus,</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> either they are diverſe from them whom <hi>Ezra</hi> mentions, or, which <hi>I rather ſuſpect,</hi> they are the moſt vain Fictions of <hi>Joſephus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Sanballat.</hi> Now here we have two very learned and conſiderable Authors, and both of them as great and skilful in Chronology as perhaps any Age hath had who not only deliver the ſame account of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> but make the ſame Inference of the <hi>ſuſpiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of this Story; The one with reſpect to <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and the other with reſpect both to <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Sanballat:</hi> and that which makes their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony yet more conſiderable is, (as I ſaid) <hi>that they were not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the preſent Controverſie,</hi> and conſequently could have no byaſs on their Judgments on that account. And what did our <hi>Author</hi> ſay to all this? Why truly not one ſingle word, nor ſo much as vouchſafe them the leaſt notice. I fanſie our Author ſuſpected his Anſwer would not hold out any longer, and <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>particular quarrel</hi> had quite ſpent it ſelf on the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> on <hi>Salian</hi> and <hi>Calviſius,</hi> and having not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ready, or perhaps not knowing how to fit that fine Character to <hi>Lydiat</hi> and <hi>Temporarius,</hi> He e'en let them alone, and has nothing to ſay to them, tho if I maſtake not their Cenſures are as <hi>hard</hi> on <hi>Joſephus</hi> as <hi>Calviſius</hi> or any man elſe: and my <hi>quotations</hi> out of them come home to the very Caſe. He tells me, before, <hi>I call'd in</hi> Calviſius <hi>to be my Second, and that I could not have found a fitter man to take my part;</hi> and yet there were two others almoſt in the ſame place, and neither of them infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to <hi>Calviſius,</hi> who are much more fit for my purpoſe, and yet our Author (I ſuppoſe, becauſe he could not prove any <hi>malice</hi> upon them) has not one word to ſay to them, tho at the ſame time he charges <hi>me with Suſpition of Inſincerity for</hi> omitting thoſe words <hi>that make againſt me in my own Authors.</hi> But if it be an argument of <hi>Inſincerity</hi> in me to omit <hi>words</hi> that make againſt me, I pray what is it to <hi>omit</hi> two intire <hi>quotations</hi> that make againſt him?</p>
            <p>Our Author now comes to the <hi>Convocation Book,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> and begins, <hi>If our Author dealt candidly in this</hi> (i. e. the quotation out of <hi>Calviſius</hi> and the inference from it) <hi>He doth not ſo always. We have a great inſtance of the contrary in his ſhuffling and cutting with the Convocation Book.</hi> Well! To <hi>ſhuffle and cut</hi> which the Convocation Book, is not fairly done; nor yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40132:37"/>is it very fair to charge a Man with doing ſo, and not be able to prove it. But in order to that our Author ſays, <hi>He, againſt whom he writes, had urg'd the Example of</hi> Jaddus, <hi>for ſomething which the Objector doth not like, and to give the more Credit to it, he ſaith (as here he is quoted) that whether the Story be true or no, the Convocation ſeems to believe it, he gives very good reaſon to judge ſo, becauſe they have inſerted part of it into the Convocation-Book.</hi> Now all this buſineſs, which our Author puts into ſuch a ſpruce Form, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an Objection which I had rais'd, and which it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to ſpeak to conſidering the Subject matter of the Diſcourſe; there is not one ſingle word, nor intimation of all theſe fine Things, of urging the <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Jaddus; and to give the greater Credit to it, becauſe it is in the Convocation; and after that a good reaſon to judge ſo,</hi> but an Objection barely and nakedly propos'd: ſo that if our Author had pleas'd he might have let all this Flouriſh alone: for I do not know any great need, of propoſing an Objection in Mood and Figure; and making a long buſineſs of that, which may be diſpatch'd in few words. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is thus:
<q>If it be ſaid, That whether the Story be true, or no, the Convocation ſeems to believe it,
<note place="margin">Anſw. pag. 11.</note> and have inſerted part of it into the Convocation book. And it is not matter of Fact, but their ſence we are enquiring into.</q> — And to which I thus anſwer:
<q>I ſay ſo too, but I ſay likewiſe, that their ſence is not to be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their words, nor are they to be made Parties to any more of the Story, than they have inſerted in their Book.</q> — And accordingly I ſhew what they have inſerted, and conſequently to what part of it they can only be preſum'd to be Parties. And what does our Author ſay to this? Why truly he tells us, <hi>They have taken in all that the Objector hath thrown out, concerning</hi> Sanballat, Manaſſes <hi>and</hi> Jaddus, which is the pleaſanteſt anſwer in the World, for it is the very Objection, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Anſwer; and this we get by flouriſhing Things over, and we muſt have the ſame thing in <hi>Reply</hi> to an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to an Objection, which is the Objection it ſelf. Well!
<note place="margin">Convoc. Ch. 30. p. 63.</note> but they expreſly quote Joſephus <hi>for it as their Author.</hi> Right, and I wonder whom elſe they ſhould quote for it. He adds,— <hi>Tho by making his</hi> Sanballat <hi>the ſame with</hi> Nehemiah<hi>'s, it appears that they follow</hi> Scaliger <hi>and</hi> Calviſius <hi>in their Chronology.</hi> Why then I doubt they <hi>take in</hi> what our Author hath <hi>thrown out:</hi> But how does our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor collect, that they followed the <hi>Chronology</hi> of <hi>Scaliger</hi> or <hi>Calviſius?</hi> I doubt our Author muſt ſtrain a point of Chronology to prove it, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Chronology of <hi>Calviſius</hi> or <hi>Scaliger</hi> either were not extant at the ſitting of the Convocation. But that is not the Queſtion: Let them follow what Computation our Author thinks fit. It is all one in the preſent Caſe, The Queſtion we are now upon is not Chronology, but their ſence of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact. And therefore our Author adds, <hi>But for the Story they not only take is for an undoubted Truth, but they reaſon upon it, as to matter of Practice our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40132:38"/>ſays well, that</hi> Men that have any care of their Souls will hardly venture to act upon one ſingle Example, and that only vouch'd but by a ſingle and ſuſpitious Author. <hi>They may do well to conſider this that go in untrodden ways, and yet damn all them that will not follow them.</hi> Now here are two things our Author is bound to prove, and which he may do at his leaſure. 1. That thoſe that differ from him go in <hi>untrodden ways:</hi> and 2. That they <hi>damn</hi> all them that do not follow them. And 'till he can do that, his Reflection turns upon him; But theſe are big words, and may ſerve for ſomething or other when there is want of better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He adds, <hi>But it is upon the ſingle Example of</hi> Jaddus <hi>having ſworn to</hi> Darius, <hi>that the Convocation ſaith, that the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>High Prieſts were bound to the Kings of</hi> Perſia <hi>by an Oath, when they were made High Prieſts.</hi> That is to ſay, they prove a matter of Fact by an Inſtance; and I wonder what way beſides there is to prove it. They prove the High Prieſts of <hi>Judea</hi> took an Oath to the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> when they were made High Prieſts, becauſe <hi>Jaddus</hi> did ſo. A great matter indeed and much to our Authors purpoſe.
<note place="margin">Convoc. Can. 30. pag. 65.</note> He goes on, <hi>And they add this judgment upon it, That</hi>
               <q>if any man affirm—</q> that <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High Prieſt did amiſs in binding his Allegiance to King <hi>Darius</hi> by an Oath, or that he had not ſinn'd if he had refus'd (being thereunto requir'd) ſo to have ſworn — he doth greatly err. <hi>It is plain,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that they affirm this upon one ſingle Example, and that alſo vouch'd but by a ſingle Authority.</hi> A very fine Reaſon indeed, What does our Author make of the Convocation? as if they eſtabliſh'd a point of <hi>practical</hi> Religion, from a <hi>ſingle</hi> Example, and by the <hi>Single Authority</hi> of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> The Point of Practice here is the <hi>Taking</hi> (yea and <hi>keeping</hi> too) of an Oath to a Lawful Prince. And our <hi>Author</hi> would make us believe, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> build this upon the <hi>Single Example</hi> of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and that vouch'd by the <hi>Single Authority</hi> of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which is a fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and makes him not only <hi>equal,</hi> but e'en Superiour to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves. Which however our Author may like, (who is ſo eager in <hi>vindicating Joſephus,</hi> that he cares not what he ſays either againſt his Adverſaries or for him.) Yet the <hi>Convocation</hi> never thought of any ſuch thing. But do they not ſay, <hi>If any man affirm that</hi> Jaddus <hi>the High Prieſt did</hi> amiſs <hi>in binding his Allegiance to</hi> Darius <hi>by Oath?</hi> Right, But do they prove whether this was <hi>amiſs</hi> or no by <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Practice? And do they not ſay, <hi>or that he had not</hi> ſinn'd, <hi>if he had refus'd ſo to have ſworn.</hi> Right again, but do they prove whether he had, or had not, <hi>ſinn'd</hi> by his own <hi>taking</hi> or <hi>refuſing</hi> the Oath? which are pure Proofs and like our Authors <hi>unanſwerable</hi> ones. And therefore our Author (who complains ſo much of Inſincerity for omitting what makes againſt a man) hath himſelf left out the principal thing, and which would plainly have ſhew'd the ſence of the Convocation.
<note place="margin">Convoc. <hi>pag.</hi> 64.</note> For thus they begin that very <hi>Canon</hi> our Author refers to.
<q>If any man therefore ſhall affirm, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40132:38"/>to the grounds and Truths of the ſaid Holy Scriptures,</hi> either that albeit the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi>— or that the <hi>Jews</hi> might lawfully have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd, — or that <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High Prieſt did amiſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err.</q> So that 'tis plain enough, the foundation of their Reaſoning here is, the <hi>grounds and Truths of the Scriptures,</hi> and whoever affirms, That <hi>Jaddus</hi> did <hi>amiſs</hi> in binding himſelf by Oath to <hi>Darius,</hi> or that he had not <hi>ſinn'd</hi> if he had refus'd ſo to do, he doth greatly err; and the reaſon of that is, not becauſe <hi>Jaddus</hi> did, or did not, ſo, much leſs becauſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaid it; but becauſe it <hi>is contrary to the grounds and truths of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> So that with our Authors good leave, They do not argue from the <hi>Story</hi> to Practice, <hi>i. e.</hi> to eſtabliſh a practical Point, but the contrary. And yet our Author talks of <hi>Shuffling</hi> and <hi>Cutting</hi> with the Convocation; and what I wonder does He call this?</p>
            <p>Our Author indeed might fairly from hence have argued to the ſence of the Convocation, and from what he hath quoted it plainly appears to be their ſence, That for the High Prieſt to take an Oath of Allegiance to his Lawful Prince was his duty, and according to the Scriptures. And this plainly and naturally follows, whether the <hi>Story</hi> it ſelf be true or no. And accordingly my anſwer proceeds: —
<q>They mention,
<note place="margin">Anſw. pag. 11.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by approve <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s anſwer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he had ſworn Allegiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> and therefore could not violate his Oath ſo long as <hi>Darius</hi> lived; and from thence we may conclude that their ſence is, That an Oath of Allegiance was binding to a Prince, ſo long as he lived, and had not given up his Right, tho he was beaten in the Field, and fled before his Enemies.</q> — Here our Author anſwers;
<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>He was aware how much their judgment would be preferr'd before his, where he differs from them: and therefore finding them againſt him in all he hath ſaid of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitiouſneſs of the Story. He is now for compounding the matter as far as this Story will make on his ſide. He is content they ſhould believe it, provided they will give up that part of it, for which he hath rejected the whole, that is, he is content they ſhould take</hi> Joſephus <hi>for a good Author, only as far as his Authority makes for the Non ſwearers. An eaſie Reader may be perſuaded to this, but not without ſhew of proof.</hi> But where had our Author all this? There is not a word of it, nor any thing like it in my anſwer; My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is before cited <hi>verbatim:</hi> and if any Reader (let him be <hi>eaſie</hi> or difficult) can find the leaſt Intimation of any one of all theſe fine things, I will be <hi>contented</hi> to own that our Author gives my Sence, when he ſays the clean contrary. And what I wonder has the ſence of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing from a Story (true or falſe) which they have inſerted in their Book, to do with his <hi>Compoſitions, Proviſoes,</hi> Conditions, and Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? If Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> had the handling of this, He could have told him,
<note place="margin">2. Vind of the Caſe. pag. 71.</note> 
               <hi>I deſire he would keep to my words, for I will anſwer for none of his Sences, unleſs I were better ſatisfied.</hi> — I ſhall not add the reſt, it being a ſtrain
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40132:39"/>of Elocution peculiar to the Dr. and which I have no delight to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe from him. In the mean time all I ſhall obſerve is, that no body knows the vertue of <hi>Prefaces</hi> and <hi>Paraphraſes,</hi> which, with a little Art, will make a man ſay any thing in the World, and whatſoever his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer pleaſes.</p>
            <p>After this Introduction, our Author at length comes my Anſwer. <hi>And</hi> (ſays he) <hi>therefore he tells you they of the Convocation mention, and thereby approve</hi> Jaddus<hi>'s anſwer to Alexander:</hi> That he had ſworn Allegiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> and therefore could not violate his Oath ſo long as <hi>Darius</hi> lived. <hi>From hence the Objector infers, that their ſence is,</hi> That an Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was binding to a Prince ſo long as he lived, and had not given up his Right, tho he was beaten in the Field, and fled before his Enemies.— To this he anſwers, <hi>This is what the Objector would have:</hi> Very well, if this be what I <hi>would have,</hi> why did not our Author anſwer it? is the mentioning of this anſwer of <hi>Jaddus</hi> an Evidence of their approbation of it, or no? But not a word of that, which notwithſtanding is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my Anſwer. And is not what they ſay in their Canon a further confirmation of it.
<note place="margin">Gan. 30. pag. 65.</note>
               <q>If any Man ſhall affirm — that <hi>Jaddus</hi> — having ſo ſworn, he might lawfully have born Arms himſelf againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> or have ſollicited others whether <hi>Aliens</hi> or <hi>Jews</hi> thereunto:</q> He doth greatly err. This I think is as fair a proof of their ſence of this Matter as need to be, and conſequently that the Doctrine before is their ſence. But tho our Author will not anſwer this, yet he doth not think ſo; and therefore tells us, <hi>The ſence of the Convocation will beſt appear by their own</hi> words. <hi>And thus they go on with the Story.</hi>— Alexander <hi>by Gods Providence having vanquiſh'd the</hi> Perſians, (that is, having overthrown <hi>Darius</hi> the King of the <hi>Perſians</hi> upon which the Monarchy of the <hi>Grecians</hi> began.) Theſe words within the Parentheſis are our Authors, not the <hi>Convocations. The</hi> Jews <hi>among many other Nations became his Subjects. He dealt favourably with them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd them of ſome Payments, and granted them Liberty to live according to their own Laws.</hi> Our Author adds, <hi>Theſe laſt are the words of</hi> Joſephus <hi>in that very Chapter which was quoted before in the Convocation-book, and the things here ſpoken were done by</hi> Alexander <hi>then, when he was at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>two years before the Death of</hi> Darius. <hi>In Conſequence hereof the Convocation declare in their Canon, That</hi> if any man ſhall affirm — That the <hi>Jews</hi> generally both Prieſts and People, were not the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Authority was ſetled among them, as they had been before the Subjects of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> — He does greatly err. In anſwer to this I have theſe things to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which our Author cites here out of the Convocation is not from the Chapter in which the anſwer of <hi>Jaddus</hi> is mention'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by approv'd, nor yet from the Canon of that Chapter, but from another, and which is of a diſtinct Conſideration, and which plainly concerns, quite
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40132:39"/>another ſtate of affairs than what they conſider in the foregoing Chapter and <hi>Canon.</hi> Now in the foregoing Chapter, they mention <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s anſwer to <hi>Alexander</hi> and approve of it; They likewiſe take notice of <hi>Darius</hi>'s <hi>over throw</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and particularly at the end of <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s anſwer, they add as their own Remark. <hi>Darius being by flight eſcaped, when his Army was diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited,</hi> i.e. <hi>Darius</hi> was alive tho beaten and overthrown; and therefore <hi>Jaddus</hi> could not agree to the Requeſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> without violating his Oath. And if any Man can make any other ſence of it, I ſhould be glad to ſee it. And this is the plain ſtate of this Matter in this Chapter: and then in the latter end of the Canon to the ſame Chapter, they intimate that <hi>Jaddus</hi> having <hi>ſo ſworn,</hi> it was unlawful for him to take up Arms againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> or <hi>to perſuade others thereunto:</hi> Now if this <hi>Canon</hi> refers to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and 'tis ridiculous to think otherwiſe, then 'tis as plain as the Sun; that the Convocation thought his Oath bound <hi>Jaddus not to take up Arms himſelf againſt</hi> Darius, <hi>nor to perſuade</hi> others, when he was <hi>overthrown</hi> and <hi>diſcomfited,</hi> but yet ſo as he himſelf by <hi>flight</hi> had eſcaped. But here (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Promiſe) I muſt conſider what Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p. 8.</note> who makes ſome anſwer to this tho our Author doth not; and he ſaith, <hi>The Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in their Canon take no notice, that</hi> Jaddus <hi>having ſworn to</hi> Darius <hi>could not ſubmit, or ſwear to any other Prince while</hi> Darius <hi>lived.</hi> They do not ſay ſo indeed in ſo many words, but they are very particular in the Chapter; and in the Canon, they intimate, that by vertue of this Oath, he was not to take up Arms himſelf againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> nor to <hi>ſollicit others, Jews</hi> or <hi>Aliens.</hi> And if there be any Connexion between the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Chapter:</hi> it is plain, this refers to what they had ſaid concerning <hi>Jaddus</hi> and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the Chapter; and the ſence is, that notwithſtanding the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and diſcomfiture, they mention in the Chapter, yet <hi>Darius</hi> being himſelf eſcaped; The Obligation of his Oath to <hi>Darius</hi> held him, ſo as it was not lawful for him to take up Arms againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> nor ſollicit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <hi>i.e.</hi> in the Circumſtances mention'd in the Chapter <hi>when he was eſcaped by flight and his Army diſcomfited.</hi> And this is plain and natural, and the <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> are all of a piece, and the Contexture uniform, but to ſuppoſe that what they ſay relative to the <hi>Oath</hi> in the Chapter, and what they ſay <hi>relative</hi> to the ſame Oath in the Canon of the ſame Chapter, That they are of a diſtinct nature and Conſideration, is to ſuppoſe that the faireſt way of interpreting Men, is in contradiction to themſelves. Well, but the Doctor ſays, <hi>It is plain</hi> Jaddus <hi>himſelf did not mean this by it, for he immediately ſubmitted to</hi> Alexander <hi>before the laſt fatal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of</hi> Darius — <hi>The meaning then of</hi> Jaddus<hi>'s Anſwer to</hi> Alexander, <hi>was no more but this: That the having ſworn Allegiance to</hi> Darius,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks</hi> Alleg, conſid. p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>could not make a voluntary Dedition of himſelf to</hi> Alexander, <hi>which was the thing deſired.</hi> This hath already been very well anſwered by a learned Pen, and thither I ſhall refer the Doctor, and the Reader, and ſhall only add,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40132:40"/>that what the Doctor gives as the Reaſon and meaning of <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer why he could not ſubmit to <hi>Alexander,</hi> was notwithſtanding the very thing, He did. He tells us the meaning was, <hi>having ſworn to</hi> Darius, <hi>he could not make a</hi> voluntary Dedition <hi>of himſelf to</hi> Alexander; and yet, however it came to paſs, this was the thing he did; He made a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Dedition</hi> of himſelf to <hi>Alexander.</hi> For he deliver'd up himſelf, and the City, without either <hi>Siege,</hi> or <hi>Stroke,</hi> or <hi>Summons:</hi> and if ſo ſoon as an Enemy comes before a Town, the Governour and Inhabitants open the Gates, and deliver up the Keys, and themſelves, if this be not a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Dedition,</hi> no man living knows what it is. And as to the <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs</hi> of it, it could not have been more <hi>voluntary</hi> if it had been done, when <hi>Alexander</hi> was before <hi>Tyre:</hi> there was indeed this difference, that <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded their Submiſſion then; but here was not ſo much as that. If therefore <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Oath oblig'd him from a <hi>voluntary</hi> Dedition, then it oblig'd him from <hi>that</hi> Dedition, which is inconſiſtent with that very ſence of his Oath; which the Doctor makes to be his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And I will appeal to any Man, whether if a Governour of a City or Caſtle, had only taken a ſolemn Oath, not to make a <hi>voluntary Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of himſelf, (and yet an Oath of Allegiance is much more than that; but ſuppoſing only ſuch an Oath, whether in the Eſtimate of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he would not be <hi>perjur'd</hi> if he ſhould act in the ſame manner, as <hi>Jaddus</hi> here by the Dr. and our Author is repreſented to have done. And ſo the Dr. hath finely mended the matter, and to ſave the Example of <hi>Jaddus;</hi> and to ſuit it to his purpoſe he hath prov'd him, and repreſents him, as a plain violater of his Oath, and that <hi>formally</hi> (according to the Doctors diſtinction) as acting againſt his own ſence and judgment of the Oath he had taken: and ſo at laſt he hath made a fair Example of it, and much good may it do him.</p>
            <p>I now return to our Author, and to connect the Diſcourſe (which the anſwer to the Dr. hath a little interrupted.) We may remember that in anſwer to what he cited out of the Convocation; I ſaid, That it was taken out of another Chapter, and is of diſtinct Conſideration from that in which they mention the anſwer of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Darius.</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they ſay in the next Chapter, as our Author cites them: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander <hi>by Gods Providence having vanquiſh'd the</hi> Perſians: <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other Nations became his Subjects.</hi> By being <hi>Vanquiſh'd,</hi> can never be interpreted to mean the ſame <hi>overthrow</hi> and <hi>diſcomfiture</hi> of <hi>Darius,</hi> which they mention in the former Chapter; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, they ſtill ſuppoſe <hi>Jaddus</hi> the Subject of <hi>Darius,</hi> and that he ought not to take up Arms againſt hm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here in this Chapter, they ſuppoſe the <hi>Jews, Prieſts and People,</hi> Subjects to <hi>Alexander</hi> to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes. Which plainly denotes a very great variation of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40132:40"/>Circumſtances. And therefore by <hi>overthrow</hi> in the former Chapter, they mean, and ſo expreſs it, when his Army was beaten, <hi>but he was eſcaped,</hi> and in that ſtate, Allegiance was due to him, and the force of <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Oath remain'd. But by <hi>Vanquiſhing</hi> here, they mean a total and final ſubduing when <hi>Darius</hi> was kill'd, and the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy at an end; and this plainly appears from the Expreſſions themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſay, Alexander <hi>having vanquiſh'd the</hi> Perſians, <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>became his Subjects:</hi> whereas according to our Author's Notion, it ſhould have been ſaid, when <hi>Alexander</hi> had vanquiſh'd the <hi>Jews,</hi> they became his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. It is plain enough therefore that they date the ſubjection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not from any Victory, or Dedition of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, but from the <hi>vanquiſhing of the Perſians,</hi> which plainly reſpects the deſtruction of that Monarchy: and it is not only a great force and ſtrain upon the word, but even contrary to common Sence; to ſay, the <hi>Perſians</hi> were <hi>vanquiſh'd</hi> when the King was living, in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Perſia</hi> it ſelf, and a numerous and potent Army at his Heels. From whence 'tis plain enough, that the Convocation, expreſſing this, not by the ſubmiſſion of <hi>Jaddus</hi> and the People, but by the vanquiſhing of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> nor yet dating <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Government over them from any ſuch ſubmiſſion and conſent, but from the <hi>vanquiſhing</hi> aforeſaid, have no manner of reference to ſuch a Submiſſion, (and which is one Evidence they never believ'd it) but refer to quite another ſtate of Affairs than what they mention in the Chapter before, and conſequently by <hi>vanquiſhing the</hi> Perſians here, they do not mean the two Victories <hi>Alexander</hi> had over <hi>Darius</hi> before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the anſwer of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> but the laſt fatal and concluding Battel, which put an end to <hi>Darius</hi>'s life, and to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. And that they <hi>only</hi> meant this, is farther confirmed in that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſay, the <hi>Jews</hi> (<hi>among</hi> many <hi>other Nations</hi>) became his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. This plainly refers to the end of that Monarchy, and the death of <hi>Darius.</hi> When indeed <hi>Alexander</hi> had <hi>many</hi> Nations ſubjects to him; but not ſo before, and eſpecially at that time he is repreſented to come to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> His Conqueſts were then but of a ſmall extent to what they were afterwards. And put theſe together, the Convocation dates <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Government over the <hi>Jews</hi> from his <hi>vanquiſhing</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and adds withall, That they became his Subjects among <hi>many</hi> other Nations. I think no man can reaſonably doubt but that they had an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the determining of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, and ſeem plainly to mean that <hi>Judea</hi> followed the Revolution of that Empire, and became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Alexander,</hi> as the reſt of the Nations did upon the death of <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An this is a plain Anſwer to what follows in our Author; I had ſaid,
<q>for the other part of the Story of <hi>Jaddu</hi>'s ſubmitting to <hi>Alexander</hi> while <hi>Darius</hi> was living, the Convocation take no notice of it.</q> He anſwers,
<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
               <hi>They do not name</hi> Jaddus <hi>indeed: but what ſaith he to theſe words,</hi> that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40132:41"/>Jews generally both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and People were the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Alexander?</hi> why truly I ſay nothing at all to them, for they do not concern the preſent Queſtion. Theſe words are in the Convocation, and if they thought that <hi>Jaddus</hi> was then living, they might mean him as well as any body elſe. But the Queſtion is, Whether they thought <hi>Darius</hi> then living, and <hi>it does not appear any where that they thought ſo.</hi> Our Author anſwers, <hi>No! Doth it appear that they thought what they writ?</hi> Yes ſure, but I muſt tell our Author, that will not be granted to every body, and I ſhould go near to fanſie that a Man that contradicts himſelf, twice in two or three lines does not <hi>think</hi> what he writes. For Proof of this he adds, <hi>Their Book ſaith, He by flight eſcaped, when his Army was diſcomfited.</hi> Right, but I have told him already they ſay it on another Occaſion, and with reſpect to another ſtate of Affairs: it is the ſubject of another Chapter, in which they plainly ſeem to approve <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s anſwer, which is a direct contradiction to our Author. And they add in their Canon to it; and which alſo plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to it, that by vertue of his Oath to <hi>Darius,</hi> it was not lawful for him to take up Arms againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> nor to ſollicit others, <hi>Jews</hi> or Aliens. This addition of <hi>Aliens</hi> is very remarkable, there is not the like again in the whole Convocation, and it ſeems plainly to refer to <hi>Alexander</hi> or his Army, who at that time were in actual Arms againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> or at leaſt to the neighbouring Countries, who might be tempted to revolt from their King in his declining Condition, and take part with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. However, this ſingular Expreſſion means ſomething. And when in this place only they add <hi>Aliens,</hi> it ſeems plainly to reſpect that juncture, and immediately to refer to the flight and diſcomfiture of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> they had mention'd in the Chapter; and I ſhall refer it to any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader, whether he can make any other fair Conſtruction of it. In the Chapter they approve <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s reſolute anſwer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he could not yield to his demands, (viz. to <hi>aſſiſt him in his Wars and become Tributary</hi>) becauſe he had taken an <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>Darius</hi> which he could not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late while <hi>Darius</hi> lived. And in the Canon they ſay,
<q>If any Man ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffirm, — that <hi>Jaddus</hi> having ſo ſworn, might lawfully have born Arms himſelf againſt <hi>Darius,</hi>
               </q> or have ſollicited others, whether <hi>Aliens</hi> or <hi>Jews</hi> thereunto, he does greatly err— which plainly and in all points concurs with <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s anſwer; and is the very ſame thing in other words. He might not bear Arms himſelf, and therefore could not become the Subject of <hi>Alexander.</hi> He might not ſollicit <hi>Aliens,</hi> and therefore could not <hi>aſſiſt</hi> him in his Wars. And the <hi>placing</hi> of this deſerves conſideration; It is ſaid, firſt <hi>Aliens,</hi> and then <hi>Jews,</hi> which intimates, as if that was chief in the Eye of the Convocation, and which plainly runs parallel with <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s anſwer, and ſeems directly to refer to it, when he was requir'd to aſſiſt <hi>Aliens</hi> againſt his own King, <hi>when he was eſcaped by flight, and his Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited.</hi> So that this Part of the Canon is nothing elſe, but the jadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40132:41"/>of the Convocation concerning this Conduct of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and they plainly determine that what he did, was but his duty, and what he ought to have done. From whence nothing is more plain than that it is the ſence of the Convocation, that it is not lawful for a Man to become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or to aſſiſt another prevailing Prince, if his own King be living, tho he be beaten in the Field, and fled before his Enemies. Our Author adds, <hi>And though they do not ſay</hi> Darius <hi>was living when</hi> Alexander <hi>came to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>yet no learved Man can be ignorant, that he lived Two years after this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſpeaks a little more to, and therefore I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it altogether. To what I ſaid,
<q>That the ſence of the Convocation is not to be extended beyond their words.</q> — The Doctor ſays,
<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 19.</note> 
               <hi>This I grant:</hi> But to the other Part,
<q>nor are they to be made Parties to any more of the Story than they have inſerted in their Book.</q> He ſays, <hi>This I deny;</hi> and his Reaſon is, <hi>For if they believ'd any of the Story upon</hi> Joſephus<hi>'s Authority, for the ſame reaſon they muſt believe all, and if they paſs their judgment on a matter of Fact, ſuch wiſe men ought to be preſumed, to judge upon the whole matter of Fact, eſpecially when different Circumſtances will alter the nature of the Action.</hi> Now this is true enough, but nothing at all to the purpoſe; for the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> that the Convocation paſs their judgment on, they do conſider the whole of it; and that is the anſwer of <hi>Jaddus</hi> to <hi>Alexander.</hi> But the ſubmiſſion of <hi>Jaddus</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards is another Story, and not one and the ſame: and I do not ſee any reaſon why, becauſe they give their judgment on one matter of Fact, and ought therefore to be preſumed to judge upon the whole of <hi>that</hi> matter of Fact, therefore they ought to be preſumed to judge upon the whole of another matter of Fact, which they give no judgment, nor take any manner of notice of. If a Man quotes one Story out of an Hiſtorian, is he therefore preſently bound to anſwer for all the Stories the ſame Hiſtorian tells, tho they be in the ſame place, or refer to the ſame Perſon? and if he does not, muſt his Judgment and Wiſdom be call'd in queſtion? This is the Caſe here, the Convocation take one Story out of <hi>Joſephus</hi> concerning <hi>Jadus,</hi> and muſt they therefore be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for every thing <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays of <hi>Jaddus</hi> in the ſame Chapter, tho they take no notice of it? A Man would imagine the Inference was the clean contrary; and that becauſe they take no notice of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not at all to be concern'd in it, nor intitled to it; their very pretermiſſion of it (when it lay ſo fair for them according to their Courſe and Method) one would think is a ſufficient reaſon of their diſlike of it. And it is ſomewhat hard that it muſt be father'd upon them, whether they will or no.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40132:42"/>
            <p> Well! But the Doctor adds, <hi>According to our Author's Opinion it makes a great difference, in</hi> Jaddus<hi>'s ſubmiſſion to</hi> Alexander, <hi>whether</hi> Darius <hi>were living or dead. And can we think ſuch wiſe men, as made up that Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſhould not conſider this? tho, as he ſays, they take no notice of it: and if they did conſider it, and took their Story from</hi> Joſephus (<hi>and it ſeems by him, they could have it from no other Author, it is plain they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> Darius <hi>to be living when</hi> Jaddus <hi>who was his Subject, and had ſworn Allegiance to him, notwithſtanding this ſubmitted to</hi> Alexander, <hi>which ſhews what their Opinion was, That Subjects who had ſworn Allegiance to their Prince might yet, when under Force, as</hi> Jaddus <hi>was become the Subjects of another prevailing Prince.</hi> Now all this Reaſoning the Doctor confutes himſelf; For thus he Prefaces what he has to Reply to the Caſe of <hi>Jaddus.
<note place="margin">Vindic. P. 18.</note> This I muſt ſay, that if they part with this Story, they loſe ſo glorious a Teſtimony (as they uſed to account it) to the indiſpenſable Obligation of an Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, while the King to whom we have ſworn Allegiance lives, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in poſſeſſion, or out of it.</hi> Very well, then I ſuppoſe thoſe Men did believe <hi>Darius</hi>'s being <hi>living or dead,</hi> made a great difference with reſpect to <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s ſubmiſſion, and yet it ſeems they <hi>did not conſider this.</hi> And then it follows, that Men may take that Story from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and argue from it, and yet not preſently be ſuppos'd to think <hi>Darius</hi> then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and it is plain, no Man did think ſo, that made that Argument, and made uſe of that Teſtimony for that purpoſe: Well! but theſe I doubt are <hi>ſome Men,</hi> for the Doctor calls them—<hi>They,</hi> and ſo perhaps may not come within the Character of <hi>ſuch wiſe Men.</hi> Well, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Doctor himſelf were one of thoſe Men, then I hope it is not ſo utterly impoſſible, but a wiſe Man may take that Story, and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether <hi>Darius</hi> was living. And to my knowledge the Dr. took this Story out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and argu'd upon it, and yet for all that did not then think that <hi>Jaddus</hi> confuted it himſelf; and truly, for any thing I know, no one elſe beſides himſelf then did ſo, tho he is now pleas'd to ſay, They <hi>uſed to account it ſo glorious a Teſtimony.</hi> And therefore the Doctor hath the leaſt reaſon of any Man to give this for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; for if <hi>Jaddus</hi> himſelf hath <hi>confuted</hi> the Teſtimony, the Doctor himſelf hath <hi>confuted</hi> his <hi>Anſwer;</hi> for it is plain enough from his own Practiſe, that Men may take this Story from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Darius</hi> was living, when the <hi>Jews</hi> became Subjects to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> for he himſelf did ſo; And why might not the Convocation do ſo, as well as he? And there is yet more reaſon for the Convocation, for the preſent Controverſie was not then on foot, nor the <hi>de facto</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in every Mans mouth, and in every Pamphlet; all which was the Caſe of the Doctor when he conſider'd <hi>Joſephus;</hi> and if in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the Doctor could overlook all this, I hope the Convocation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40132:42"/>might do it, and yet be very <hi>wiſe Men</hi> too! And what wonder is it, if Men are not ſo very crititcal and punctual, in examining all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a Story, what if they took the Story juſt as they found it as the Doctor did, without conſidering what <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaid before or after, or without conſidering what <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi> had ſaid, and comparing them with <hi>Joſephus?</hi> This is matter of every days obſervation, and the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> Men are often guilty of it. And ſuppoſe it was an overſight, muſt Men preſently be intitled to the Doctrines that are conſequential to thoſe very things which they have overſeen? We look into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, not for <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> but for <hi>Doctrine:</hi> And it is a pleaſant Buſineſs indeed, when we are inquiring into the ſence of the Convocation, we muſt have it from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and not from the Convocation it ſelf. The plain Queſtion is, whether the Convocation did believe that <hi>Darius</hi> was living when the <hi>Jews</hi> (in their account) became Subjects to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Yes, ſaith the Doctor, <hi>becauſe ſuch wiſe men ought to be preſum'd to judge upon the whole matter of Fact.</hi> Yes, ſaith our Author, <hi>becauſe no learned Man can be ignorant that he liv'd two years after this.</hi> That is to ſay, you muſt take the ſence of the Convocation from the conſiderations and Collections that theſe Gentlemen think convenient, for them (whether they were concern'd in them or no) and if you intend to know the ſence of the Convocation, you muſt apply your ſelf to <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, Curtius</hi> and <hi>Arrian,</hi> and diligently compare them together, and then you cannot miſs of it, which is a pure way of interpreting of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: Whereas I always thought that every Author was his own beſt Interpreter; and 'tis a ſtrain of Intepretation and fit only to ſerve ends and purpoſes, when Men will not take an Author as they find him; but beſides his own account will ſeek out for other matters, to ſquare and meaſure his ſence by: and 'tis plain enough, that theſe Gentlemen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make out their Point from the Convocation it ſelf, otherwiſe they would never have ſought out for forein Helps and Aſſiſtances; which in ſhort, is nothing elſe but to make a ſence for themſelves, but not to take it as they find it.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, for the Doctor hath once more <hi>confuted</hi> his own Reaſonings here; for to my Anſwer, That this Story (as 'tis told by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>) is an <hi>exempt Caſe,</hi> for that <hi>Jaddus</hi> had a <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſo does not come within the Compaſs of the ordinary and ſtanding Rules the Dr.
<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 20.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. <hi>We are now diſputing about the ſence of the Convocation, and therefore muſt remember, that the Convocation does not aſſign this Reaſon, why</hi> Jaddus <hi>after his Oath to</hi> Darius, <hi>ſubmitted to</hi> Alexander. Very good! And where then is the force of this Reaſon, <hi>if they paſs their judgment on a matter of Fact, ſuch wiſe Men ought to be preſumed to judge upon the whole matter of Fact, eſpecially when different Circumſtances will alter the nature of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:40132:43"/>I hope <hi>Revelation</hi> in this Caſe is a <hi>different Circumſtance</hi> that will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the nature of the Action. And if the Doctor will not admit that to be the ſence of the Convocation, becauſe they do not aſſign it as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s account of their ſubmiſſion is not their ſence, for neither do they aſſign that account of their becoming the Subjects of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</hi> But this matter we come now to debate; and here the Doctors Anſwer, and that of our <hi>Author</hi> is the very ſame; our Author indeed ſays a little more to it, and therefore I ſhall follow his Method.</p>
            <p>My Anſwer is this,
<note place="margin">Anſw. p. 12.</note>
               <q>Grant the Story true, it is not to the purpoſe it is us'd for. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, God appear'd to <hi>Jaddus</hi> in a Dream, and warn'd him to ſubmit to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to meet him in that ſolemn manner he did. So that this is a ſingular and exempt Caſe, and falls within the Circumſtances of <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author puts off his Anſwer to this, and falls firſt upon an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had rais'd to it,
<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> and tells us, <hi>He is aware that there is a prejudice againſt this, namely,</hi> That Prophecy was then departed from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. He anſwers,
<note place="margin">Mal. 4.3.</note> 
               <hi>This is certainly true,</hi> Malachi <hi>having given them warning, that the next Prophet that ſhould come would be</hi> Elias. But the <hi>Objector ſhifts off this by telling us, That</hi> when there were no more Prophets, yet ſtill there was an inferiour degree of Prophecy, which laſted for a long time as the <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> and probably ſome other way, as by Dreams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>To make way for theſe: He tells us,</hi> it was always the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, in great Extremity, to have recourſe to God, for ſome expreſs Revelation what they ſhould do. To this he anſwers, <hi>This is more than the</hi> Jews <hi>knew, or they did not think of it, at that time when</hi> Judas Maccabaeus <hi>being ſlain, there was a great affliction in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the like whereof was not</hi> ſince the time that a Prophet was not ſeen among them,
<note place="margin">1 Maccab. 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>for then they took mere human Counſels, without looking for any expreſs Revelation.</hi> But that is more than our <hi>Author</hi> knows; and the Text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates no ſuch thing. The Text ſaith indeed, <hi>the like affliction was not ſince the time that a Prophet was not ſeen among them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>l.</hi>

                  </gap> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> But that is but a Date of Time, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf interprets it, <hi>ſo great a Calamity as was not ſince the</hi> Babyloniſh <hi>Captivity,</hi> and yet there were Prophets among them ſince that, tho but few, and not of the ſame rank with thoſe before. And it is reaſonable ſo to interpret it; for the Text plainly reſpects, and refers to a great Affliction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and ſuch as was Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that Condition they then were in, and which cannot well be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be any other than their general Captivity: for there was no ſuch extraordinary change of their Affairs in the times of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and eſpecially at that time that <hi>Malachy</hi> the laſt of the Prophets is ſuppos'd to live. But however, ſuppoſe theſe words reſpected the laſt of the Prophets, and when there were no more ſucceeding in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40132:43"/>Church? What then? might there not be an inferiour degree of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and God might communicate his Will in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and upon extraordinary Occaſions? and that ſo communicated be a ſufficient Warrant and Direction to them? And therefore ſuppoſe they in that extremity took <hi>meer human Counſels,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> did that very often, when they had conſtant and ſtanding Prophets among them, and not only ſo, but even contrary to God's <hi>expreſs Revelations</hi> delivered by thoſe Prophets. As, beſides other places, is manifeſt in the Prophecies of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and particularly in the Caſe of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and of the People flying into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And what <hi>meer human Counſels</hi> were theſe that they took? Why truly, after the killing of <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> they choſe <hi>Jenathan</hi> his next Brother to be their Captain and Ruler. And what difficulty was there in that? Or what need was there of <hi>Divine Revelation?</hi> Or what Reaſon had they to expect it in ſuch a Caſe? This was natural and proper, and there needed no eſpecial Direction in that matter: when they were in diſtreſs before under their own Kings, and when they had Prophets among them, when one King was dead, they did not apply themſelves to a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or wait for <hi>expreſs Revelation</hi> to ſet his Son or Heir on the Throne. Nor was there any need here, when it was in their own power, to chuſe whom they pleaſed, to wait for Divine Direction; for the Theocraſie was long ſince ceaſed, and they were at their Liberty. But it had been much more for our Author's purpoſe, if it could have been but prov'd, that while <hi>Judas</hi> had been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and inſiſted on his Right to the Government, they had choſe him too, they ſhould have choſe another againſt his Conſent. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would have been to take <hi>meer human Counſels, i.e.</hi> contrary to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, and which indeed would have needed a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> to juſtifie. But what need of ſuch a Revelation in an ordinary and ſtanding Caſe, and in which they had ſufficient means to direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>But after all, the main point in queſtion is not in the leaſt ſpoken to, and our Author gives no Anſwer to it. And that is, <hi>That when there were no more Prophets, yet there was an inferiour degree of Prophecy in the</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh <hi>Church, as the</hi> Bath Kol, <hi>and probably ſome other way, as by Dreams,</hi> &amp;c. This our Author repeats, and then leaves it, as if it did not concern the Queſtion; and falls upon another thing concerning their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God in extremity for ſome expreſs Revelation, and anſwers even that myſtically and obſcurely, that they did not know it, or not think of it in a particular inſtance. And what then, might there not be ſuch a thing in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church for all that? And the Queſtion is plain before him; after the ceaſing of the Prophets, was there ſuch an inferiour Degree of Prophecy in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, or no? This he cannot deny, but yet will not own it, and ſeems to inſinuate, as if he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40132:44"/>would have his Reader believe there was no ſuch thing. It was not indeed conſtant and ſtanding to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church after the ending of the Prophets. And therefore could not ordinarily be applyed to, as the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and the Prophets. But that it was ſome times, and God in ſome Caſes did in an extraordinary manner manifeſt his Will to them, as far as I know, is diſputed by no Learned Man. And this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the purpoſe I mentioned it. And the plain Queſtion is, whether ſuch a Manifeſtation of the Divine Will, when ever, and upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſoever it was, was not a ſufficient Warrant for Practice, and would juſtifie their acting in ſuch Caſes againſt ordinary and ſtanding Rules? Which, I think, no Man will deny. I ſhall apply this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>And accordingly I aſſerted, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us here were all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to it, they faſted and prayed. Our Author anſwers, <hi>In diſtreſs to faſt and pray, and to ſeek to God for Deliverance, hath been uſed in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church.</hi> Right, but what follows? The next night God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and ordered him ſo to do; I had added that,
<q>As we have the Story from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſo we muſt have it all from him, and he tells us ſo expreſly, and God's Appearing and Command ſtands upon the ſame Authority with all the reſt of the Story.</q> Our Author an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>Here he would make us believe we have a Wolf by the ears; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we admit or deny this we are in his danger either way.</hi> Now the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I had urged, tho it was not in Mood and Figure, was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, and to liken it to a Beaſt with <hi>ears</hi> is an Alluſion a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical. But our Author, I ſuppoſe, doth not mean with reſpect to the <hi>ears,</hi> but to the <hi>danger;</hi> for a <hi>Wolf</hi> is a <hi>dangerous</hi> Creature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if a Man hath him by the <hi>ears,</hi> and do not hold him faſt. And therefore he goes on. <hi>If we deny this part of the Story, why may not the Objector deny all the reſt? But if we admit it, then it is wholly beſides the purpoſe; for</hi> (adds our Author) <hi>ſays he (with his uſual Civility:)</hi> If theſe Gentlemen will ſhew us any expreſs Revelation for what they do, as <hi>Jaddus</hi> had, then they ſay ſomething, but 'till they can ſhew that, this Example, if true, will do them no ſervice. Our Author anſwers, <hi>He hath obliged me ſo much with this Complement, that I cannot chuſe but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that there was an expreſs Revelation.</hi> Well, I am glad I have <hi>obliged</hi> our Author, ſo as to admit of any thing that I ſay. This is the firſt time, and therefore I will not be behind hand, but give him thanks, and ſhould be glad, if I could meet with any other occaſion for it, before his Book is ended. But theſe Obligations upon <hi>Complements</hi> are of very ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. For he immediately adds,: <hi>But I cannot grant him his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, 'till I ſee how it follows from the Premiſſes.</hi> Now a Man would have imagined, at firſt ſight, that the <hi>Conſequence</hi> was as clear as the Sun; for if <hi>Jaddus</hi> acted by Revelation, and <hi>They</hi> by ordinary and ſtanding
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40132:44"/>Rules, it plainly <hi>follows,</hi> that his Example neither reaches their Caſe, nor is for their purpoſe. But this our <hi>Author</hi> will not admit; for he adds, <hi>In order to this he ſhould have told what Revelation it was</hi> Jaddus <hi>had, and what uſe it was for, and then have ſhewed that we have the like occaſion, before he had required us to ſhew the like Revelation. But ſince he is ſo ſhort in theſe things, I muſt be the longer in conſidering them more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Take every thing as the Objector would have it, that</hi> Jaddus <hi>had a Revelation, that he ſhould</hi> ſubmit <hi>to</hi> Alexander, <hi>tho</hi> Darius <hi>was living, and notwithſtanding his Oath, by which</hi> Jaddus <hi>formerly thought he was bound to the contrary. If</hi> Jaddus <hi>was then in the right concerning the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his Oath to</hi> Darius, <hi>the thing that he was now put upon, was the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sin of Rebellion aggravated with perjury, and whatever elſe the Objector thinks fit to load his Brethren with, only this of</hi> Jaddus <hi>he tells us was</hi> an exempt and ſingular Caſe, <hi>for he was put upon it by Divine Revelation.</hi> Very well! and this anſwers all that black Charge our Author hath ſo formally drawn up, and is plainly implyed and ſuppoſed in my Anſwer: and our Author admits it too; and what then, I wonder, made him make ſuch a formal Harangue about nothing. I ſuppoſe becauſe (as he ſays) I had been ſo <hi>ſhort,</hi> therefore he would be the <hi>longer.</hi> Well! but tho that might do well enough for <hi>Jaddus,</hi> yet it will not ſerve for the people: for he adds: <hi>But even in this Caſe there would have been ſomething elſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to engage the People to go along with him in this ſubmiſſion;
<note place="margin">Chap. 4.3.</note> for ſince now they are to look for no Prophet more, till the coming of</hi> Elias, <hi>as</hi> Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi <hi>told them, but were left under a ſtrict charge to</hi> remember the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Statutes and Judgments. <hi>This Change of their Allegiance from</hi> Darius <hi>to</hi> Alexander, <hi>being, as the Objector will have it, Rebellion and Perjury, than which nothing can be more contrary to the Law of God, how could</hi> Jaddus <hi>hope to bring them to this, by telling them only that he had a Revelation from God! He could not pretend to it, without making himſelf as great a Prophet as theſe were by whom theſe Precepts were given. And then he muſt prove it, by ſhewing ſuch ſigns as thoſe former Prophets did. Otherwiſe the</hi> Jews <hi>were ſo far from being bound to believe him, that they were to look on him as a falſe Prophet, and as ſuch to put him to death. We ſee how ready the</hi> Jews <hi>were to execute this upon our Saviour, as oft as he ſeemed to teach any thing contrary to their Law, tho he did prove himſelf a Prophet by working of Miracles. But</hi> Joſephus <hi>doth not tell us that</hi> Jaddus <hi>did any Miracle: (if he had we ought not to have believ'd him) and yet the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church at that time was ſo far from ſtoning</hi> Jaddus <hi>for pretending this Revelation, that they all joyned with him, in ſubmitting to</hi> Alexander, <hi>even while</hi> Darius <hi>was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. And therefore we may be ſure, that this Revelation was not againſt their</hi> common and ſtanding Rules; <hi>as our Objector will have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this I have theſe things to ſay:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:40132:45"/> 1. Our Author's Argument is equally valid againſt all Prophets and Prophecy among the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince the promulgation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as againſt this inferiour Degree of Prophecy now before us. He does not quote the Text, nor yet refer to it, I ſuppoſe, leaſt the Reader ſhould conſult it, and plainly perceive the inconſequence of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it is (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) the Sum of which is, <hi>If there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe a Prophet, or Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth a ſign or a wonder, and the ſign or the wonder come to paſs whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods, and ſerve them, thou ſhalt not hearken unto that Prophet, for the Lord your God proveth you — And that Prophet ſhall be put to death,</hi> &amp;c. Now our Author tells us, that Jaddus <hi>could not pretend to a Revelation (contrary to the Law of God)</hi> i.e. (contrary to ordinary and ſtanding Rules) <hi>without making himſelf as great a Prophet as thoſe were by whom theſe Precepts were given,</hi> and of <hi>proving it by ſhewing ſigns and miracles.</hi> Whereas 'tis plain enough the Text makes no difference in that, but expreſly declares the contrary. And let men pretend themſelves to be what Prophets they pleaſed, even as great as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and work Signs and Wonders, and which accordingly ſhould come to paſs, yet if they taught them to ſerve other Gods, they were not to be believed but to be put to death. And what then? therefore they might not act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ordinary and ſtanding Rules in particular Caſes, when God hath declared his Will by Prophets, or by other Revelation. This is a pure Conſequence; our Author's Argument equally reſpects Prophets and Miracles, as any other Revelation; and tho its true, none of theſe were ſufficient warrant to ſerve other Gods, yet 'tis plain enough they were to act againſt the ordinary Rules, as in the Caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſpoiling the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and in the Caſe of <hi>Joram</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> had the People, of their own Heads, ſet up <hi>Jehu,</hi> and kill'd <hi>Joram,</hi> it had been <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and our Author muſt own it; but when God had declared his Will by his Prophet, they ceaſed to be ſo, which notwithſtanding without ſuch a Revelation would ſtill have retained their criminal Nature. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would ask our Author one plain Queſtion, whether Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which way ſoever it is manifeſted, be not a ſufficient Warrant to act againſt ſtanding and ordinary Rules? And it would be a pleaſant thing if any Man ſhould deny it. 'Tis true indeed, it being againſt theſe ſtanding Rules, may (in fit Circumſtances) be a reaſon to believe that 'tis <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> Deluſion, or Temptation, and no Divine Revelation; but when the <hi>Revelation</hi> is granted (as our Author grants it) to talk of <hi>Miracles, Stoning,</hi> and I cannot tell what, is mere wandring and fancy, and nothing at all to the purpoſe. And as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the Story, 'tis plain enough that <hi>Jaddus</hi> himſelf, and the People were ſufficiently ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the Truth of the Revelation, and accordingly immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40132:45"/>with it, and upon confidence of it preſently opened their Gates, and put themſelves into the power of <hi>Alexander;</hi> whom they knew to be an enraged Enemy; which they never would have done, if they had not confided in the truth of the Revelation. So that the whole Queſtion returns to this, Could the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in thoſe days have any <hi>Divine Revelation?</hi> Or was it againſt their conſtant and ſtanding Rules that they ſhould have any? This indeed our Author's Argument ſeems to drive at, when he tells us, <hi>they were to look for no Prophet more, but were loft under a ſtrict charge to obſerve the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then this is an Argument not only againſt the Uſes and Ends of this <hi>Revelation</hi> (which is the Controverſie between us) but againſt any <hi>Revelation</hi> at all, (which our Author allows.) If indeed there was no <hi>Revelation,</hi> nor could be at that time according to <hi>their</hi> Law, when all Prophecy was cloſed up with <hi>Malachi,</hi> then our Author's <hi>Uſes,</hi> and mine, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>'s are all alike. But if there was, then 'tis plain there was an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Degree of Prophecy</hi> continued to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church after there were no more Prophets, and here my <hi>Dilemma</hi> turns upon him, either there was ſuch a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or there was not; if there was, then it was a ſufficient Warrant for Practice againſt ordinary and ſtanding Rules, and all our Author's Arguments here ſignifie nothing. If there was not, then <hi>Joſephus</hi> is miſtaken in his Story, and as our Author ſays, <hi>If we deny this part of the Story, why may not the Objector deny all the reſt?</hi> And ſo our Author hath his <hi>Wolf by the ears</hi> ſtill, and he may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold him, or let him go as he pleaſes. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Author makes a great difficulty of it, how the People ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and ſays, <hi>How could</hi> Jaddus <hi>hope to bring them to this?</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not <hi>pretending himſelf as great a Prophet as thoſe by whom the Precepts were given,</hi> and not <hi>ſhewing Signs or Miracles, or if</hi> Joſephus <hi>had ſaid he had, we ought not believe him.</hi> Now truly if there was any ſuch thing, what Methods <hi>Jaddus</hi> had to make them believe it, or what Evidence he gave of the Revelation, <hi>Joſephus</hi> is ſilent. But it ſeems (as he tells it) they did believe it, and upon that belief, ventured their Lives to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Prince who had vowed Revenge on them. And I would fain ſee a Reaſon why they might not as well believe it to warrant their Practice, as to encourage their Hopes; for if it was a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> (and they believ'd it as ſuch as 'tis plain they did) it would do one as well as the other. And I ſuppoſe their Conſciences, under the Direction of a Divine Revelation, were in no more hazard, than their Lives.</p>
            <p>At laſt our Author tells us,
<note place="margin">Pag 26.</note> 
               <hi>Theſe words upon which all the Argument moves, were thruſt in by the Objector, namely, the words</hi> to ſubmit, <hi>and that we ſhall find nothing in</hi> Joſephus <hi>of any Revelation that</hi> Jaddus <hi>had to</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and to meet <hi>Alexander. There was no occaſion for it, for thus far he had determined already, before the Prayer and Faſting upon which he had the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40132:46"/>Revelation. Theſe are</hi> Joſephus <hi>his Words, Alexander</hi> having taken <hi>Gaza,</hi> made haſte to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> Jaddus, upon hearing of this was, in an agony of fear, being at his Wits end to think how he ſhould meet the <hi>Macedons,</hi> the King being angry at his Diſobedience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. <hi>It ſeems he was reſolved to have no more anger on that account, but to make his peace by an humble ſubmiſſion, and therefore he was in care how to</hi> meet the <hi>Macedons,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſephus, who thus goes on:</hi> Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered the People to make Supplications, and himſelf with them offering Sacrifice to God, he beſought him to protect the Nation, and to deliver them from the imminent Dangers. <hi>It is plain, that theſe were Prayers for a Deliverance, and not for a Revelation as the Objector is pleaſed to ſay. But was there not a Revelation after this? Yes it follows, That</hi> after the Sacrifice, when he was gone to Bed, in his ſleep, God bade him be of good courage, and let them crown the City, and open their Gates. And for their <hi>Meeting, (which they had reſolved before, but were in care how to do it, ſo as might move the King's favour and compaſſion)</hi> Let them go <hi>(ſays he)</hi> the reſt in white Garments, but he with the Prieſts in thoſe Veſtments which the Law hath preſcribed, and be confident they ſhall ſuffer no evil, for that God will provide for them. And then our <hi>Author</hi> adds, <hi>Here is every word of the Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this I have theſe things to obſerve:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our <hi>Author</hi> tells me, <hi>I thruſt in the words upon which all my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument moves, namely to</hi> ſubmit, <hi>of which there was nothing in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> mentioned by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and yet, however it comes to paſs, our Author has <hi>thruſt</hi> them in himſelf; for he tells us Jaddus <hi>was reſolved to make his peace by an humble</hi> Submiſſion. And how does he prove this? why Jaddus <hi>being in an agony, and at his wits end how to</hi> meet Alexander, <hi>and as for their</hi> Meeting <hi>that they had reſolved before.</hi> But where is <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> all this while? Why 'tis included in the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and <hi>Jaddus</hi> was reſolved to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to, becauſe he was reſolved to <hi>meet, Alexander.</hi> And is not this a very pleaſant Buſineſs? if they <hi>reſolve</hi> to <hi>meet</hi> him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then it means <hi>Submiſſion;</hi> but if God commands them to <hi>meet</hi> him, then <hi>to ſubmit</hi> is <hi>thruſt</hi> in by the Objector. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. How does our <hi>Author</hi> prove that <hi>Jaddus</hi> reſolved to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> before the <hi>Revelation?</hi> Why he offers at it by what <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, relating to Matters before the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and by what he ſays, as he reports the Revelation it ſelf: but neither of them are to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays before the Revelation, that is, when <hi>Jaddus</hi> heard of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s haſtening to <hi>Jeruſalem, he was in an agony, and at his wits end how he ſhould</hi> meet <hi>the</hi> Macedons, <hi>the King being angry at his Diſobedience formerly.</hi> From whence our <hi>Author</hi> concludes, that <hi>he was reſolved to have no more anger on that account, but to make his peace by an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40132:46"/>humble Submiſſion.</hi> Or, as Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> renders it,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vindic. p.</hi> 20.</note> 
               <hi>to attone for his former contumacy by an early ſubmiſſion.</hi> But how does this follow from the words of <hi>Joſephus?</hi> For as the Learned Author, above-mentioned, hath very well obſerved, the word here uſed by <hi>Joſephus</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) may be taken in a <hi>hoſtile</hi> ſignification; and the (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) may be rendred not how he ſhould <hi>ſubmit,</hi> but how he ſhould <hi>fight</hi> with the <hi>Macedons.</hi> And ſo it is uſed in S. <hi>Luke (ch.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 31.) <hi>whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet</hi> him (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand. And this is yet farther confirmed,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> for that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> himſelf uſes it in the ſame ſenſe in this very Chapter, when he tells us that <hi>Darius</hi> hearing that <hi>Alexander</hi> had paſſed the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and at <hi>Granic.</hi> had conquered his Lieutenants, having gathered an Army of Foot and Horſe (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) determin'd to <hi>meet</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi> before they had ſubdued all <hi>Aſia.</hi> Now, I ſuppoſe, no Man thinks that when <hi>Darius</hi> determined (as in our <hi>Author</hi>'s phraſe was <hi>reſolved</hi>) <hi>to</hi> meet Alexander, it was with intentions of <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> and to yield up his Crown to him, or in Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Language, to <hi>attone for his former contumacy,</hi> in having reſiſted his entrance upon his Kingdom, but in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> with him. Now I would fain know why the <hi>ſame</hi> word in the <hi>ſame</hi> Author, and in the <hi>ſame</hi> Chapter is not alſo to be underſtood in the <hi>ſame</hi> ſenſe? And that which yet farther confirms this, is</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Joſephus</hi> plainly alters the Expreſſion, when he mentions their <hi>meeting</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> by the Command of God in the Revelation, and it is not there that God commanded him (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and afterwards upon <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s actual <hi>Meeting,</hi> he expreſſes it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is both a differing Expreſſion, and a differing Sence, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies to meet another <hi>Honoris gratiâ,</hi> out of deference and honour to him, and ſuppoſes Duty and Submiſſion. And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the contrary. However I build no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the Criticiſm. But the Expreſſion being varied by <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> himſelf, is a plain proof that he meant two things, and it is not very accountable how he ſhould alter his Words, and yet mean the <hi>ſame</hi> thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which further confirms this Interpretation is, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays <hi>Jaddus</hi> was in an agony how he ſhould <hi>meet</hi> not <hi>Alexander,</hi> but the <hi>Macedons,</hi> in the plural number, whereas had the Buſineſs been (as our Author and the Dr. fancy) Attonement and Supplication, it ſhould have been, how he ſhould <hi>meet Alexander</hi> or the King, for, I hope, <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> did not intend to ſupplicate the whole Army. But when it is ſaid to <hi>meet</hi> the <hi>Macedons,</hi> it plainly means the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Macedons</hi> in the ſame ſenſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays before, that <hi>Darius</hi> determined to <hi>meet</hi> the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> i.e. their <hi>Army,</hi> and to ſtop their Progreſs. And indeed in this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40132:47"/>ſenſe there was reaſon enough for <hi>Jaddus</hi> to fear, how he ſhould hinder the Approaches of a victorious Army, and defend himſelf and the City from them that had beaten <hi>Darius</hi> in the Field, and but juſt before had made ſuch terrible Work at <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Gaza.</hi> And acccordingly (as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> tells it) they took a proper courſe, and applyed themſelves to God by Faſting and Prayer, and beſought him for <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and not as our <hi>Author</hi> would fain have it, that their <hi>Submiſſion</hi> (which they had <hi>reſolved</hi> on before) might be acceptable in the Eyes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or that they might be recommended to his favour. Well, but does not <hi>Joſephus</hi> tell us, that the <hi>King was angry at his former Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> (or rather <hi>imperſuability or ſtiffneſs</hi> in not yielding to <hi>Alexander</hi> to become his Tributary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he ſent to him; for that ſenſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will bear, and is more agreeable to the Story.) Right, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was the more reaſon of fear, apprehending himſelf not able to reſiſt. But as our Author hath handled the matter, all this terrible Fright was for nothing elſe, but leſt his Submiſſion ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: and ſo as our <hi>Author</hi> repreſents him, <hi>Jaddus</hi> had made a fair Game on't, he ſends a fooliſh Anſwer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and then was <hi>at his wits end</hi> how to attone and make amends for it. Well, I perceive this very <hi>Cluthaean Sanballat</hi> took a much better courſe, for (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath it) he went early to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and carried with him eight thouſand Men, and was received with Honour and Favour, and yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> does not ſpeak very commendably of that Action, and can hardly forbear calling him a Traitor for his pains. But it ſeems, as our Author interprets <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> he muſt be much the wiſer, yea, and the honeſter Man. For it ſeems <hi>Sanballat</hi> took time by the foretop, and did his Duty <hi>early,</hi> but <hi>Jaddus</hi> was forced to an after-reckoning, and <hi>at his wits end</hi> how to heal up the Diſobedience of his former Anſwer. I wonder what Notions ſome Men have of Virtue, Honour, or Conſcience: is it agreeable to any of theſe for a Governour of a Town, (and eſpecially for ſuch a one who hath taken an Oath of Fidelity to his Prince) to deliver it up ſo ſoon as the Enemy appears before it, and not only ſo, but to be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Agonies and Perplexities for not having done it before? And I would appeal to all the World, whether <hi>Batis,</hi> who ſo gallantly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gaza</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> tho he loſt his life in the Attempt, was not more faithful to his Maſter, and perform'd his Duty with more Honeſty, as well as Courage, than <hi>Sanballat</hi> (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> delivers it) who made a plain defection from him, or than <hi>Jaddus,</hi> either according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that our Author, and Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> have given of him. I know Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. p.</note> That <hi>Jaddus</hi> by his Anſwer meant no m ore, but that he would not make a <hi>voluntary Dedition</hi> of himſelf, that is to ſay, he performs all the parts of an honeſt and faithful Governour, that does not give up himſelf to an Enemy that is fifty Miles off, and only ſends a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40132:47"/>Meſſage to him, but if he comes himſelf with an Army, 'tis honourable and faithful, and the Town and People are all his own. And yet as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as this is, if it were granted him, it will not ſolve the buſineſs: For he tells us,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That Jaddus his Care was how he might attone for his former Contumacy,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Contumacy</hi> of his former Anſwer. Now to <hi>attone</hi> for any Action, implies the <hi>renouncing</hi> it; and ſo <hi>Jaddus,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>renounced</hi> his Anſwer, (as the Dr. hath ſome of his Principles) and took care to make timely Satisfaction by an <hi>early Submiſſion.</hi> But then what becomes of <hi>Voluntary Dedition?</hi> Why perhaps the Doctor might mean he would not go of himſelf till he was <hi>ſent</hi> for. And ſo we have an admirable Character of a good Governour, his <hi>Oath</hi> and his <hi>Honour</hi> oblige him to keep the City or Country till he is <hi>asked the Queſtion,</hi> and Conquerors muſt be cruel and hard-hearted indeed, if they will not vouchſafe to <hi>ſend</hi> for a Surrender. And yet at this fine rate do theſe Gentlemen treat <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and to magnifie his Example, and to fit it to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, make him one of the <hi>meaneſt</hi> and <hi>moſt contemptible</hi> Perſons in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come now to conſider, how our Author proves <hi>Jaddus</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> before the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the Report <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> makes of that <hi>Revelation,</hi> and here our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, that <hi>after the Sacrifice, when he was gone to bed, in his ſleep, God bad him be of good courage, and let them crown the City, and open their Gates.</hi> And for their <hi>Meeting</hi> (which (ſays our <hi>Authour</hi>) they had reſolv'd before, but were in care how to do it, ſo as might move the King's Favour or Compaſſion) <hi>Let them go, the reſt in white Garments, and he with the Prieſts in the Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Law hath preſcrib'd,</hi> &amp;c. Now here we have a pure ſtrain of Interpretation, and plainly ſhews, how our <hi>Authour</hi> can ſay any thing that makes for his purpoſe. The whole ſtreſs of our <hi>Author</hi>'s Argument, is to make it appear, that (according to <hi>Joſephus</hi>) <hi>Jaddus</hi> had reſolv'd to ſubmit to <hi>Alexander</hi> before he had any <hi>Revelation</hi> from God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo to do. And then to make <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſay ſo, he turns his words upſide down, and puts in what he pleaſe, and places them as he ſees good, without either Order or Truth; and then indeed it is ſomewhat hard, if upon ſuch a Liberty, a Man cannot make <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſay what he hath a mind to.</p>
            <p>And here, as he hath placed the Words and put in his own Additions, he would make his <hi>Reader</hi> believe, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> repreſented it, as if he had already concluded to meet <hi>Alexander</hi> in a poſture of Submiſſion; whereas there is no ſuch thing in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> nor any thing like it: Here he ſays, <hi>And for their</hi> Meeting; and from thence infers, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to do it before; whereas both <hi>for</hi> their meeting, and the placing of it (which plainly alters the Senſe) is purely his own; all that <hi>Joſephus</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40132:48"/>ſays, is, that <hi>God bad him be of good courage, and to crown the City and open the Gates,
<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and the reſt in white Garments, but him, with the Priests, in the Veſtments which the Law preſcrib'd,</hi> (or legal Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to <hi>meet</hi> him. And where, now I wonder, is this; <hi>And</hi> for <hi>their Meeting,</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> begins the matter with, tho <hi>Joſephus</hi> placed it laſt, and from whence he would fain conclude, that this Meeting was reſolv'd on before; whereas 'tis plain enough, by the placeing of theſe Words in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and by the connecting the Sentence by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctives, that the ſame Command that bad him be of good courage, bad him alſo to <hi>meet</hi> him: But this would not ſerve our <hi>Author</hi>'s turn, and therefore he is for beginning at the latter end, and not only ſo, but for putting in Words of his own. He tells indeed <hi>here is every word of the Revelation,</hi> Right, and ſomewhat more to, even ſome Words of our <hi>Author,</hi> and theſe very Words of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are put out of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which make a new Senſe of them, and the very thing in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is plainly, if not induſtriouſly perverted. Is there no difference with our <hi>Authour</hi> between God's commanding them to be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and to <hi>meet</hi> him, and bidding him be of good courage, and <hi>for their meeting?</hi> But if <hi>Joſephus</hi> is not for our <hi>Authour</hi>'s purpoſe, he hath an Art to make him; 'tis but ſlipping in a <hi>Particle,</hi> and placing his Words to the beſt advantage, and then he may do very well; and whether he ſpeaks his own Senſe or no, he ſhall be ſure to deliver our <hi>Author</hi>'s Senſe.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all this matter is contain'd in theſe two Queſtions, 1. Whether a Divine Revelation be not a ſufficient warrant to practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ordinary and ſtanding Rules? 2. Whether, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the Story, <hi>Jaddus</hi> had not a Divine Revelation authorizing and appointing his and the Peoples particular Behaviour in this matter; it is plain enough, that the whole Action (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates it) was directed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the <hi>Habit,</hi> the <hi>Solemnity,</hi> the <hi>Meeting,</hi> all were of Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But theſe Gentlemen would fain confine the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to the Manner only, and not to the <hi>Meeting</hi> it ſelf; as if the ſame Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that directed them to <hi>meet Alexander</hi> in their Pontificalibus, and in that ſolemn manner, did not as well direct the <hi>Meeting</hi> as the <hi>Manner</hi> of it. And it is a pure Conſequence, God directed them to <hi>meet</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Manner,</hi> and therefore he directed the <hi>Manner,</hi> and not the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Juſt as if a Maſter ſhould command a Servant to put on ſuch a Habit, and attend on another Perſon; why truly he commands him to put on his beſt Cloaths, but as for his <hi>Attendance,</hi> he may do as he ſees good, his Maſter's Command does not extend to that. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would ask theſe Two <hi>Authors,</hi> Whether <hi>Meeting</hi> be not in the Revelation? And then I would fain ſee a reaſon, why the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40132:48"/>does not extend to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> as well as to all the reſt. Well, Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> hath one thing yet behind, and he tells us,

When God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his Son, he anſwer'd no Queſtion about the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of ſuch Sacrifice; when he commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſpoil the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he anſwered no Queſtion about the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of their taking their Jewels and Goods from them; when, notwithſtanding, by virtue of a Divine Revelation, thoſe reſpective Actions were lawful, and a Duty to them, which otherwiſe would have been utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And it is very pleaſant to talk of a Revelation anſwering the Queſtion about the Lawfulneſs, when the Lawfulneſs it ſelf depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Revelation.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40132:49"/>But he is not for mentioning that, and taking things altogether, but he likes cutting an Objection into halves, nay into quarters, as we ſhall ſee preſently, and then diſputing upon it.

               <q>An Argument from Example is at beſt but a poor one, but it muſt be very poor indeed, when the Example it ſelf is doubtful. The practice of the High-Prieſt in that corrupt ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, will not ſignifie much to us, and no more in this, than in their other Immoralities. And <hi>Jaddus</hi> becoming a Subject to <hi>Alexander</hi> contrary to his Oath, is no more a Pattern for us to follow, than <hi>Eliaſhib</hi>'s building a Chamber in the Temple for <hi>Tobiah,</hi> is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for us to act contrary to the expreſs Law of God. But then it muſt needs ſignifie much leſs, when that practice wants ſufficient clearneſs and evidence to prove it.</q>—Now if our <hi>Author</hi> had put this altogether, and taken it as he found it, his Animadverſions of <hi>(putting this out of its place,)</hi> would have appear'd very pleaſant; for where, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, could this have been ſo pertinently brought in, as to confirm my Inference from the ſuſpiciouſneſs of that Example: And it would have been very proper indeed to talk of an Example according to ordinary Rules, after the conſideration of the <hi>peculiar and exempt Caſe</hi> of Divine Revelation. For let the Practice be evident or not evident, let that ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church be corrupt or not corrupt, if they acted by Divine Revelation, it does not come under common and ordinary Conſideration, and conſequently does not at all affect that Argument. And (by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) that ought to have been ſpoke to when I was ſpeaking of ordinary Caſes. It is plain enough therefore that our <hi>Author</hi>'s Animadverſion was not to correct my Method, but to make way for his own; he could not tell how to ſpeak to this in its proper place, for then he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have anſwered it all, or at leaſt have mention'd it, and therefore, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, it is <hi>put out of its place,</hi> that is to ſay, our <hi>Author</hi> hath <hi>put it out of its place</hi> for his own purpoſe, and not only ſo, but out of its <hi>ſenſe</hi> too, for the force of it lies in the Connection. <hi>An Argument from Example
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40132:49"/>is a poor one, eſpecially a ſuſpicious Example;</hi> and this confirm'd by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>The Practice of the High-Prieſt in that corrupt ſtate of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church, ſignifies no more than their other Immoralities, and</hi> Jaddus<hi>'s Submiſſion no more than</hi> Eliaſhib<hi>'s building a Chamber in the Temple for</hi> Tobiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if this had been mention'd together, our <hi>Author</hi>'s Anſwer would have been much to the purpoſe; for he tells us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſpeaks as if</hi> Jaddus <hi>were ſingle in this act of Submiſſion,
<note place="margin">p. 29.</note> when it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the whole Church of God, at that time, went along with him;</hi> and ſuppoſe it, what then? Is an Example from a corrupt ſtate of a whole Church a better Argument for practice than the Example of the High-Prieſt? To prove his Point, he might, if he had pleas'd, have produc'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> worſhipping the <hi>Golden Calf.</hi> But to ſhew our <hi>Author</hi> the Vanity of his Method, I anſwer, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the ſtory, they acted by <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and therefore let it be <hi>Jaddus</hi> himſelf, or the whole Church, 'tis all one, neither of them are an Example for us, when their Caſe and Circumſtances were peculiar and extraordinary. And by this time, I ſuppoſe our <hi>Author</hi> ſees, who hath <hi>put this out of its place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! Our <hi>Author</hi> adds, <hi>he tells us</hi> of that corrupt ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s time: Our <hi>Author</hi> anſwers, <hi>This is News;</hi> that is to ſay, our <hi>Author</hi> never heard of it before; I am ſorry for that; for I thought that the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>minor Prophets,</hi> yea, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> too, might have a little inform'd him about that matter. Well, but our <hi>Author</hi> ſays, <hi>All ancient Writers ſpeake of theſe times, as the beſt that ever were under the ſecond Temple.</hi> Now methinks our <hi>Author</hi> ſhould have oblig'd his <hi>Readers</hi> with one of theſe <hi>antient Writers</hi> at leaſt: But no ſuch matter, if you will have them, you muſt look them your ſelf, for he has not named one, no not ſo much as refer'd to one in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and yet to tell us <hi>all</hi> antient Writers ſpeake ſo, is ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. Now I muſt earneſtly deſire our <hi>Author,</hi> for the credit of this peremptory Aſſertion, that he will be pleaſed to name one <hi>antient Writer</hi> that ever ſaid ſo, or any thing like it; and if he cannot do that, (as I am bold to ſay, I utterly deſpair of) that he will name ſome <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> Writer; and if he cannot do that neither, this muſt go for a bold Stroke. For when a Man calls in <hi>All</hi> Writers to his aſſiſtance, the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous World are apt to think themſelves impos'd upon, if he has not ſo much as <hi>one ſingle</hi> Writer ready at hand to juſtifie what he ſays. And therefore, once again, I muſt preſs our <hi>Author,</hi> for his own ſake, to make this out by plain proof from any one Writer, beſides himſelf, in all the World. I confeſs, our <hi>Author</hi>'s Aſſertion is ſtout and generous, that <hi>the Times of</hi> Jaddus <hi>were the</hi> beſt (with reſpect to the Virtue of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church) and not only ſo, but more ſuperlatively, <hi>the</hi> beſt that ever were <hi>under the ſecond Temple.</hi> And here (to ſpeak plainly) I doubt our <hi>Author</hi> cannot only not produce one ſingle Writer that ever aſſerted it,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40132:50"/>but not one ſingle Man that heretofore or now ever believ'd it. Well, but our <hi>Author</hi> proves it, <hi>The Church was much reform'd by thoſe excellent Men that flouriſhed in the Age next before, namely, by</hi> Nehemiah, Ezra, <hi>and</hi> Malachi: Very good, and therefore I hope the Age <hi>next before,</hi> that was reform'd by theſe <hi>Excellent Men,</hi> was the <hi>beſt that ever was</hi> under the ſecond Temple, and not the Age that follow'd; and yet if any Man looks into the Books of <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> or <hi>Malachi,</hi> he will find ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to believe, that notwithſtanding the Care and Endeavours of thoſe Excellent Men, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was very corrupt in their Practices in thoſe times; and there is much more reaſon to believe it, when the Authority and Perſwaſion of thoſe Excellent Men were ceaſed with their Perſons.

                  <hi>Ganz.</hi> p. 58. <hi>Id.</hi> p. 66.</note> But our <hi>Author</hi> adds, <hi>At this very time, beſide</hi> Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus <hi>himſelf, whom the</hi> Jews <hi>make the last of the Men of the</hi> great Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, <hi>there was alſo</hi> Benſira, <hi>as they tell us, a ſhining Light to the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>and one that much advanc'd the Honour of our God.</hi> But where had our <hi>Author</hi> all this? Why truly out of thoſe very <hi>Jewiſh Chronologers</hi> our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> mentions with ſo much ſcorn before, and tells me theſe things <hi>might be excuſed in a Jew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 14, 15.</note> and evenpoor <hi>David Ganz</hi> is quoted alſo for it in the Margent. Well, I perceive theſe ſame <hi>Jewiſh Chronologers,</hi> if they write againſt <hi>Joſephus,</hi> they are a Company of baſe and envious Fellows; but if our <hi>Author</hi> can pick any thing out of them for his turn, they may paſs ſo far for good and ſubſtantial Hiſtorians. But after all, our <hi>Author</hi> has made the moſt woeful Conſtruction out of them that ever was made out of any Author:
<note place="margin">Tempus Benfirae ignoramus ſed juxta verba autoris Meor enajim <hi>cap.</hi> 22. fuit Benſira diebus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meouis juſti. Mentionem facit hic Benſira ſub finem libri, à me viſi, Simeonis Juſti, &amp; narrat cum ejus laude quod fuerit Iſraelitis tanquam Lux ſplendens, &amp; quod tenebras ab illis diſpule rit, &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit honorem Dei noſtri, <hi>p.</hi> 66.</note> He ſays, <hi>They tell us that</hi> Benſira <hi>was a ſhining Light to the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>and one that much advanc'd the Honour of our God;</hi> whereas they ſay not one ſuch word of <hi>Benſira,</hi> but of <hi>Simon Juſtus,</hi> and conclude that <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſira</hi> lived in the days of <hi>Simeon; becauſe at the end of his Books, he ſpeaks to the commendation of him, that he was a ſhining Light to the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>diſpears'd their Darkneſs, and encreas'd the Honour of our God.</hi> (The whole is in the Margent.)</p>
            <p>And our <hi>Author</hi> interprets all this, as ſaid of <hi>Benſira</hi> himſelf. And to make this yet more pleaſant,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 50.</note> our <hi>Author</hi> adds, <hi>After them was</hi> Omas <hi>the High Prieſt, and his Son</hi> Simon, <hi>whoſe Praiſe ſwells a Chapter in</hi> Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus. After whom, I pray? Why, after <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Benſira.</hi> Now this <hi>Benſira</hi> was the Author of <hi>Eecleſiaſticus,</hi> and after him came <hi>Omas,</hi> and after <hi>Onias</hi> his Son <hi>Simon;</hi> and ſo about two High-Prieſts after himſelf, <hi>Benſira</hi> wrot a whole Chapter in praiſe of <hi>Simon,</hi> I find it is nothing with our <hi>Author,</hi> for a Man to write a whole Chapter in Commendation of another, about 50 Years after he himſelf hath been dead: I hope, all things conſider'd, no Man will hereafter queſtion our <hi>Auther</hi>'s Skill in <hi>Chronology.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:40132:50"/>
            <p> Well, how unluckily ſoever our <hi>Author</hi> proves his Point, yet it may be there may be ſome Argument in it, if times and things could agree, and therefore, for Argument ſake, I do not much care if I grant him (in the preſent Diſpute) that <hi>Jaddus</hi> and <hi>Benſira,</hi> and <hi>Onias,</hi> and his Son <hi>Simon,</hi> were Contemporaries, and flouriſh'd in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church at the ſame time, which is as much as he can deſire, and more than he can prove: I will give him, likewiſe, that each of them <hi>ſwell'd</hi> a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> in their Praiſe, as well as one of them; and what then? Therefore the ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was not corrupt in their times; this is the Queſtion before us, and it is a pure Proof indeed, for the Virtue of a whole Age, to number three or four Excellent Men that then lived. I could tell him of an Age where there was <hi>Seven Excellent Men,</hi> and of higer ſtations than <hi>Benſira,</hi> which, notwithſtanding, will be no proof, but that that Age was very corrupt, both in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices.</p>
            <p>But tho I am willing to grant this, for Argument ſake, it is, I confeſs, more than our <hi>Author</hi> asks, or pretends to prove, and all that he ſays, is, that <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> reformed the Church the <hi>Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> and <hi>Jaddus</hi> then lived, and <hi>Benſira</hi> no body knows when, and the Age after that <hi>Onias,</hi> and the Age after him <hi>Simon,</hi> who was a very good Man, according to <hi>Eccleſiaſticus:</hi> So that, after all, our <hi>Author</hi> can find not one in the times of the preſent Controverſie, but even <hi>Jaddus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and about whom is the Controverſie. And yet after ſuch Proofs as theſe, he falls on me without Mercy. <hi>His branding of thoſe excellent Men and the Church of God in thoſe times, may teach us to bear the Characters he gives us more patiently: Patiently</hi> does he call it? It is a pure Inſtance of Patience, indeed, to tell me I <hi>brand</hi> Excellent Men, whom I neither named nor thought on, and to make proof of it, to run a whole Age backward and forward to find out Men to make me lay an Imputation on, and yet, forſooth, he bears it <hi>patiently.</hi> And juſt ſuch another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Virtue of <hi>Patience</hi> in what follows, <hi>ſo when he ſaith their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> will ſignifie no more to us in this than in their other Immoralities, well this I ſaid, and I thought the thing was plain enough, and if not, why does not our <hi>Author</hi> diſprove it? Why, perhaps his <hi>Patience</hi> will not ſuffer him to do that. But however he tells us, <hi>The meaning is, there muſt be other</hi> Immoralities <hi>in them that differ from him in his Point, ſo here we have a Teſt to try who are, and who are not honeſt Men.</hi> An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conſequence indeed, becauſe the practice in a corrupt ſtate of a Church, is no more a Preſident than their other Immoralities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that differ from me are <hi>guilty of other Immoralities.</hi> Now, when our <hi>Author</hi>'s hand was in, I wonder he did not charge this matter home, and tell me, becauſe, I ſay, that if this Story be true, <hi>Sanballat</hi> muſt have been 145 Years old, therefore every one that differeth from me in this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40132:51"/>Point, is at leaſt of the Age of 150, or becauſe I ſay, that as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the Story, <hi>Jaddus</hi> acted by Divine Revelation; therefore thoſe that differ from me, they are all of them Prophets. And this would have undone me for ever, and I could never have been able to prove it. And when Men are for making Conſequences, they had e'en as good make them to ſome purpoſe: And our <hi>Author,</hi> if he pleaſe, may ſay that I make all them that differ from me, <hi>Alexanders,</hi> or High-Prieſts, or <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Samaritans,</hi> for I mention all theſe words, as that I ſay they <hi>muſt be guilty of other Immoralities.</hi> But this is an invidious Inference, and our <hi>Author</hi> draws it in by the head and ſhoulders, without Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Conſequence, I ſuppoſe, by virtue of his <hi>Bearing,</hi> what I ſay <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</hi> Well, I perceive our <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Patience</hi> is as <hi>unanſwerable</hi> as his Arguments.</p>
            <p>At laſt our <hi>Author</hi> takes ſome pains to vindicate <hi>Jaddus</hi> from Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<note place="margin">p. 30.</note> and ſays, <hi>He dare be bold to ſay, he was never taxed with it,</hi> and <hi>that being a Man of that high place in the Church, and of ſo clear a Repute ever ſince in all Ages.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> ſpeaks as if he was extraordinary well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the Hiſtory of <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s Life; whereas, all that we have of him is from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and that is ſo little, that for any thing is ſaid there, he might, or he might not be a Man of Virtue. But it is plain enough, that in that corrupt ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, the Practices of the High-Prieſts were not ſo exact and regular; <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> built a Chamber in the Temple for an <hi>Ammonite,</hi> and <hi>Johanan</hi> (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us) murder'd his Brother in the Temple,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq.</hi> l. 11. c. 7.</note> of which <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it was a very great Wickedneſs, and eſpecially in a Prieſt, and ſuch a one as there was not the like to be found among the</hi> Greeks <hi>or</hi> Barbarians: And theſe, I ſuppoſe are no extraordinary Inſtances to recommend the Example of the High-Prieſts in thoſe times. And here my Reaſon comes home, it is plain enough that the High-Prieſts of thoſe times were guilty of very great <hi>Immoralities,</hi> what <hi>News</hi> ſoever it may be to our <hi>Author.</hi> And therefore their Example not to be depended on. Our <hi>Author</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Jaddus's high ſtation in the Church,</hi> as if his ſtation was higher than his great Grandfather <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> or than his Father <hi>Johanan.</hi> And therefore our <hi>Author</hi>'s following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is much to the purpoſe, <hi>What ſhould make the Objector and his Party make ſo light of ſuch an eminent and venerable Example?</hi> For if our <hi>Author</hi> means <hi>eminent</hi> for the ſtation of the Perſon, and <hi>venerable</hi> for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; as far as the Example of the High-Prieſt, in theſe times, will reach, <hi>Eliaſhib</hi>'s polluting the Temple with a Stranger, and <hi>Johanan</hi>'s killing his Brother, is every jot as <hi>eminent,</hi> and a little more <hi>venerable</hi> than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Jaddus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what our <hi>Author</hi> ſays of <hi>Jaddus's clear Repute in</hi> all Ages, I muſt needs confeſs there is an honorable mention of him in ſome good Authors. But then, I ſay, it is for that Reſolute and Loyal Anſwer
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40132:51"/>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, he ſent to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that <hi>he had taken an Oath to</hi> Darius, and <hi>could not violate it ſo long as</hi> Darius <hi>lived.</hi> But our <hi>Author</hi> and the Dr. have robbed him of that <hi>Honour</hi> and have made it juſt nothing at all, nay, have made him renounce and retract it, as our Author ſaith he <hi>corrected,</hi> Doctor Sherlock <hi>confuted</hi> himſelf <hi>what he ſaid formerly:</hi> and ſo his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> is juſt as much to his Reputation as thoſe Principles of the Doctors in the <hi>Caſe of Reſiſtance</hi> are to him, which he alſo <hi>confutes himſelf.</hi> Indeed, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells the Story, That what he did afterwards was by <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> His Honour and Vertue remain intire: and therefore if our Author pleaſe, let his Example be <hi>Eminent</hi> and <hi>Venerable</hi> ſo far as it is an Example, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>ſtanding Caſes,</hi> as his anſwer to <hi>Alexander</hi> was; but what he did by Revelation is no <hi>Example</hi> at all, nor ſignifies any thing to any Mans Practiſe but in the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; I expect our Author will ſay here as he does before,
<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>As far as the Story will make on his ſide, he is content they ſhould believe it.</hi> But that is but trifling, except he diſprove what I ſay here, That <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s being mentioned with Honour, is with reſpect to that anſwer he returned to <hi>Alexander.</hi> And our Author who inſiſts ſo much upon his <hi>Clear repute in all Ages,</hi> to make that <hi>Repute</hi> ſignifie any thing to his purpoſe, is bound to do one or both of theſe things. 1. To ſhew any Author that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Jaddus</hi> honourably, and with a Character of Vertue, who has not an immediate reference to this anſwer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> i. e. they reckon him vertuous and honourable upon that account. Or 2. That any <hi>Author</hi> mentions him with the ſame additional Characters, with reſpect to his violating his Oath, or acting in contradiction to his former Anſwer. And if our Author can do neither of theſe, (and which I muſt take for granted till I can ſee him prove the contrary; and the firſt of theſe I will engage to make good upon his Requeſt,) then it is plain, that the <hi>Clear Repute of</hi> Jaddus <hi>in all Ages</hi> is not for our Authors purpoſe, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and it depends upon that Anſwer <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith he gave to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and which <hi>Repute,</hi> our Author hath done all that he can, to take from him. And to ſay no more, <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf tells us, that <hi>Anſwer</hi> was of ſo much <hi>Reputation,</hi> as to recommend the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation to the favour of <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagi,</hi> and upon confidence of it,
<note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> to commit to <hi>their</hi> Truſt his Caſtles and Forts, as being Men faithful, and <hi>pertinacious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herers to their Oaths:</hi> and how purely this agrees with the account our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath given of it, let the World judge.</p>
            <p>I now come to examine what he ſays further upon the general Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I had made. And he adds, <hi>He tells us, Jaddus</hi> becoming a Subject ject to <hi>Alexander</hi> contrary to his Oath, is no more a Pattern for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, than <hi>Eliaſhib</hi>'s building a Chamber in the Temple for <hi>Tobiah,</hi> is an Argument for us to act contrary to the expreſs Laws of God. Our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40132:52"/>Author anſwers; <hi>This is home to the purpoſe, and being ſaid at the firſt, might have ſav'd him, and me all this trouble.</hi> Now, our Author is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the pleaſanteſt Man alive,
<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> for but the Leaf before he tells me of this very Inference, <hi>That he thinks it was put out of its place, and</hi> ought <hi>to come in here for a</hi> Reſerve, <hi>in caſe it appeared that the Story of</hi> Jaddus <hi>was not only true but to our purpoſe,</hi> then <hi>it had been time for him to tell us, that all this is nothing to him and his Party:</hi> and yet in the next Page but one, <hi>if it had been ſaid at firſt, it had ſaved us both ſome trouble.</hi> Now, how is it poſſible for me to pleaſe ſuch an Anſwerer, I put it in the middle, and then it was <hi>out of its place, and ought to come in for a Reſerve.</hi> Our Author himſelf hath put it in for a <hi>Reſerve,</hi> and hath placed it laſt, and then it might have <hi>been ſaid at firſt, and have ſaved him trouble.</hi> But if our Author had been ſo ſparing of his <hi>trouble,</hi> why did not he put it <hi>firſt?</hi> He confeſſes he hath taken it <hi>out of its place;</hi> and by the ſame Reaſon he might have put it where he had pleas'd, or at leaſt, why did not he ſpeak to it where I had placed it? and then it might have <hi>ſaved</hi> him all the remaining part of his <hi>trouble.</hi> But the truth is, had our Author put this firſt, it would have quite ſpoiled all his Book, and have ſhewn how fruitleſs and inſignificant all his Arguments were to vindicate <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and to prove the practiſe of <hi>Jaddus;</hi> for if all his Proofs were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (not one of which notwithſtanding, I believe he is ever able to make good) it was utterly inſufficient to determine the Controverſie, and to warrant practiſe in a Point ſo important as that which is before us; for the practiſe if it had been plain, and much leſs if it be doubtful, is not a ſufficient foundation for ſuch a Superſtructure our Author would build on it. And to ſay the truth, for all our Authors talk of <hi>Eminent and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Examples,</hi> he hath plainly quitted the Example it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> He hath vielded the Point that I inſiſted on, That the Example of <hi>Jaddus</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and hath put the whole Iſſue upon the nature of the Thing. And this is as much as I can deſire, and my Concluſion is gain'd, tho our Author will not admit the Premiſſes, <hi>That the Example</hi> of <hi>Jaddus</hi> in a Caſe of Conſcience of ſo high a nature is not a ſufficient Warrant and Authority to act upon; and ſo the Controverſie about the vindication of <hi>Joſephus</hi> for the preſent ends. For if there be any difference between the Practiſes of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Jaddus;</hi> that difference does not ariſe from the differing Examples (for they were both high Prieſts of the ſame Church) but from the nature of their reſpective Actions; That is to ſay, that the Example of <hi>Jaddus</hi> ſignifies no more to us (as it is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a Jewiſh High Prieſt) to transfer Allegiance after an Oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to a Prince living, and claiming, than the Example of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> does to act contrary to the expreſs Law of God. I know our Author tells me,
<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> 
               <hi>That the Scriptures ſay one is contrary to the expreſs Law of God, and I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40132:52"/>ſay the other:</hi> and then tells me, <hi>as if we were as well aſſured of what he ſaith, as what we read in Scripture.</hi> But this is all his own, what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith in the Caſe is matter of another Controverſie. The preſent Queſtion is about the Example of <hi>Jaddus;</hi> and our Author himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to juſtifie it from other Topicks, which is a Demonſtration, That that Example will not do it, which was the only thing I had to conſider in that part of the Diſcourſe. And this I think is abundantly ſufficient for the Queſtion before us. But becauſe the Author adds ſomething of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, I ſhall alſo briefly conſider that.</p>
            <p>He tells us; <hi>Now all the Queſtion is,
<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> whether</hi> Jaddus <hi>acted contrary to his Oath to</hi> Darius, <hi>in becoming a Subject to</hi> Alexander? <hi>To judge aright of this Queſtion, we muſt conſider what Circumſtances he was in at the taking this Oath, and how they were changed at the time of his ſubmitting to</hi> Alexander.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He was a Subject to</hi> Darius <hi>before the taking of this Oath, and by it, he gave no other Right to</hi> Darius <hi>than what he had before, he gave him only a greater aſſurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Right that</hi> Darius <hi>had over the</hi> Jews <hi>was no other, than what deſcended to him from</hi> Cyrus; <hi>and that was by his Conqueſt over the</hi> Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>that were their former Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That Right of Conquest being deſcended to this</hi> Darius, <hi>was won from him by</hi> Alexander <hi>that had overcome him in War, and ſo made himſelf Lord of that Countrey. And ſo</hi> Alexander <hi>now had the ſame Right to their Allegiance which</hi> Darius <hi>had before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This Right to their Allegiance being ceaſed, their Oath to him, was of no Obligation; but they were as free, and had as much reaſon to pay their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance now to</hi> Alexander, <hi>as they had formerly to</hi> Darius, <hi>or</hi> Cyrus.</p>
            <p>This is all that our <hi>Author</hi> offers in this Point; and I ſhall ſhew him the force of them, by only altering the names, and putting an inſtance with reſpect to the times of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt.</hi> And then he will ſee how admirably they will look. Suppoſe then a Subject of his who had taken an Oath of Allegiance to him; and ſuppoſe the Circumſtances ſo altered, as between his taking the Oath when hew as on the Throne, and his being beaten at <hi>Naſeby Field,</hi> deliver'd up by the <hi>Scots,</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then our Author's Propoſitions will run thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a Subject to King <hi>Charles</hi> before the taking of this Oath, and by it he gave no other Right to King <hi>Charles</hi> than what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he gave him only a greater aſſurance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Right that King <hi>Charles</hi> had over the People of <hi>England,</hi> was no other than what was deſcended to him from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. And that was by his Conqueſt over the <hi>Saxons</hi> that were their former Lords.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:40132:53"/> 3. That Right of Conqueſt being deſcended to King <hi>Charles,</hi> was won from him by <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> that had overcome him in War, and ſo made himſelf Lord of that Countrey; and ſo <hi>Oliver</hi> now had the ſame Right to their Allegiance which King <hi>Charles</hi> had before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Right to their Allegiance being ceaſed, their Oath to him was of no Obligation; but they were as free, and had as much reaſon to pay their Allegiance now to <hi>Oliver,</hi> as they had formerly to King <hi>Charles,</hi> or <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I deſire to know of our <hi>Author</hi> which of theſe Propoſitions he will deny? If he will deny none of them, then I perceive had our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor been Governour of a Town for the King in thoſe days, after the fatal Battel at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> he would have had nothing elſe to do, but to put on his <hi>Pontificalia,</hi> and deliver himſelf and his Allegiance over to the <hi>Rumpers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> or <hi>Oliver:</hi> for as he ſaith of <hi>Jaddus, He had kept his Oath to the laſt, till there was no ſuch King as he had ſworn to.</hi> But if our Author will deny any one of theſe Propoſitions, and ſhew the difference, I will engage he ſhall anſwer himſelf, and do hereby promiſe to make it good.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it is very pleaſant for our <hi>Author</hi> to talk of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and yet never take care to ſtate the nature of it, nor to ſhew when and in what Circumſtances, a Right and Title may be obtained by it, but talks of it as looſely, as if the beating an Army in the Field did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> give a Right to the Government, and diſſolve all the former Oaths and Obligations of the Subjects. And if that be the Caſe, methinks our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhould have given ſome reaſon for it, and he may yet do it; for certainly ſome Conqueſts are Invaſions and Robberies, and convey no more Right to a Crown, than a Thief hath to a Purſe, when he hath <hi>conquered</hi> the Right owner. All Men hitherto that have handled the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> have made a wide diſſerence between a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and an <hi>Uſurper:</hi> The latter of which by way of Diſtinction, they call <hi>Raptor</hi> and <hi>Invaſor,</hi> a <hi>Raviſher</hi> and a <hi>Robber,</hi> tho the Government that each of of them have, may be acquired by Victory, and the Force of Arms. And this is our Author's fundamental Miſtake: He will have them all one, and that <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is nothing elſe but Force. He makes Cowns and Empires not ſubject to the Laws of Juſtice and Equity, but ſets them up as a Priſe to be fought for, and there is no more to do, but to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> them, and wear them. Which is ſuch a Notion of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> as never was heard of in the Queſtion before us. And I deſire our Author, or any Man elſe to ſhew me one ſingle Author, who treats of the Queſtion, then uſes it in ſuch a ſence. But the truth is, theſe Men who talk at this rate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word <hi>grammatically,</hi> as if it meant nothing but <hi>beating and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi> which is nothing elſe but betraying their ignorance, inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40132:53"/>the Queſtion, and interpreting Terms of Art and Expreſſions in Law by Grammatical conſtruction, and the derivation of words: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſame word oftentimes varies its meaning in every Art or Science. Now in the preſent Queſtion, <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> whereby a right and Title to a Government is ſuppoſed to be acquired, beſides mere Victory (which as far as I can perceive is all our Author here means by it,) there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other neceſſary Conditions and Qualifications: and where they are not, any Perſon, what ſucceſs and Force ſoever he may have, hath not the Title of a Conqueror, but only the Poſſeſſion of an Uſurper. I ſhall not run into the whole of this Queſtion, It will be ſufficient here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That that is not a Conqueſt, where is not a juſt cauſe of War pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. By this I do not mean every juſt cauſe of War, but ſuch a one only as will juſtifie the taking away the Prince, and Peoples Right, <hi>i. e.</hi> when all things conſidered, the taking away that Right is a Reparation equivalent to the Injury; for what is above that is Robbery and Rapine, and can no more give one Prince a Title to another Princes Dominion, than he that takes a thouſand Pound for the injury of ſix pence, hath a juſt Title to the overplus. I know theſe things cannot be adjuſted by Mathematical meaſures; but for all that, there are Rules of Juſtice to be obſerved, tho in ſuch Caſes they may admit of ſome Latitude, and what exceeds them is plain <hi>wrong,</hi> and it is Nonſence to ſay, that <hi>wrong</hi> creates <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That is not a <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> where the Subjects of a Prince are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, tho he himſelf ſhould be overcome, or taken Priſoner; And this is as clear as any Propoſition in <hi>Euclid.</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, was taken Priſoner by <hi>Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and did he by vertue of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Right and Title to the Crown and People of <hi>England?</hi> and it is a pleaſant Buſineſs to ſay, that People are abſolved from their Oaths of Allegiance, and from the duty of Subjects becauſe they are not conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and it is a pure Argument to diſſolve the Obligations of Oaths, and to transfer Allegiance becauſe they may keep them if they pleaſe, and have power to do their Prince Right whenever they have a mind to it. This is to prove a <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> by denying it: And to ſuppoſe that a Right to a Government and People is conveyed by Conqueſt, when at the ſame time that People is not conquered, is neither more nor leſs, but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all People out of their wits: and ſuch Doctrines are fit for any thing rather than an Anſwer. I know well enough ſome men ſay here, That it is all one with reſpect to particular Men; if a Nation is not conquered, particular Men are, but it is plain, theſe Men know not what they ſay, and venture their Conſciences upon Fancy and Imagination. They have heard of <hi>Jus Belli,</hi> and a <hi>Right by Conqueſt,</hi> and without conſidering
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40132:54"/>the Queſtion, are reſolved to ſuppoſe themſelves conquered, tho at the ſame time they ſuppoſe themſelves conquered by no body but their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, which is a pure way of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> indeed to convey a Title to the Crown, and conſequently to their Allegiance. Heretofore <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> was a terrible thing, and appeared in Blood and Deſtruction, but now 'tis grown as mild and ſoft as can be; and if you have a mind to find it, you muſt not look into the Field, and conſider fighting and the Effects of the Sword, but you muſt ſearch into the moſt peaceable places of the Kingdom, in the Parhament-Houſe, and <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> which, I muſt confeſs, of all places a Man would hardly have thought to have found <hi>Conqueſt</hi> in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That is not a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> ſo as to convey a Right and Title to the Dominion of a Country, where the Legal and natural Prince of that Countrey is not deſtroyed, or ſo conquered, as either virtually or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to reſign his Right, and ſubmit to the Conqueror. And this is plainly founded on the eternal and immutable Rules of Equity and Juſtice. For no Man, (let him be under what Force he will) can give away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Right, without his own conſent. If therefore a Prince hath a Right to his Kingdom, no force upon himſeif, much leſs upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, can extinguiſh that Right, and till that is extinguiſh'd, a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror can have no right to it: for two oppoſite perſons cannot have the ſame Right to the ſame thing. And here I would ask our Author, who talks ſo pleaſantly of <hi>winning</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> which way <hi>unjuſt Force</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh <hi>juſt Right.</hi> And if this Right be not extinguiſhed, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with him; and if the Right remains with him, then the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is an unrighteous Poſſeſſor, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath no Right and Title, for no Man has a Right and Title to what he poſſeſſes unjuſtly. And then I would fain know how Allegiance and Duty ceaſes to Right, and follows Wrong and Injuſtice in oppoſition to Right. But of this our Author and the Reader may be much better inform'd from the Learned Author of the <hi>Duty of Allegiance</hi> in Anſwer to Doctor <hi>Sherlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, what has the Queſtion of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> to do in the Buſineſs? for ſuppoſe <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> in our Author's Notion, would do all theſe won ders, I hope No-Conqueſt would not do all theſe extraordinary matters too. And where, I pray, is this <hi>Conqueſt</hi> they talk on, 'tis inviſible to every body but themſelves. Did ever any Men before diſpute and argue, and take pains to prove themſelves conquered, when the perſon, whom they pretend the Conqueror, and all the Nation beſides perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned it? Thoſe that inſiſt upon this Argument, it ſeems as if their Conſciences were hard ſet, when they have nothing to ſay to juſtifie themſelves, but what contradicts their own Eyes and common Senſe. A Man would imagine, a little <hi>Modeſty</hi> without any Reaſon would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch Arguments. And if they can ſtop the Mouth of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40132:54"/>with Chimera's and <hi>Figments,</hi> much good may it do them. Should any ſober Foreigner hear of the <hi>abdicating</hi> Vote', of giving and accepting the Crown, and the Revenue belonging to it, of confining the Soveraign Power, and limiting the Succeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at the ſame time hear of a ſort of Divines that were might and main ſtretching their Wits to prove that a <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> I believe he would think ſomething or other which I will not name, for certainly ſuch a Conqueſt was never heard of, when the Conqueror muſt take Terms from the Conquered. For my part, I think Men that talk at this rate are to be looked upon as the Betrayers of <hi>Engliſh Liberty</hi> and Property. For how much ſoever they may play with it, <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is a very hard word, and means no leſs than a Title to the Property of the whole Kingdom. And all theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments plainly centre in this, That whatever was done and tranſacted in the <hi>Convention</hi> was nothing elſe but <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> in the Prince, and he vouchſafed to accept of the Crown upon theſe Terms, when it was his own before by the Rights of War. So that by theſe Mens Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Sovereign Power not being as abſolute as in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> and the Property of the whole Kingdom is pure free Gift, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Condeſcenſion; which is a Tenure not very grateful to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men. And I have often wondered, that a Nation ſo jealous of its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Privileges, would ſuffer ſuch Doctrines and Arguments to paſs abroad without <hi>Publick Animadverſion.</hi> And therefore in Defence of the Liberties of my Native Country, which theſe Arguments totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and betray, I will enter the Liſt with him when he pleaſes. And to make good his Hypotheſis, here are two things for him to prove.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Conqueſt, in his Notion, that is, Force, Power or Victory is a ſufficient Title to Dominion and Government, and gives a juſt Right to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Revolution here is a Conqueſt, the one is a general Doctrine, and the other the Application of it to the particular Caſe. And when our Author hath done theſe, by the Grace of God, he ſhall hear what Anſwer I have to return. For the preſent, I ſhall take my leave of our Author, and of his Argument from Conqueſt, with this one Remark, <hi>That thoſe who have been early in a Revelation, and have ſet their Heads and Shoulders to it. For them to juſtifie their Compliances by Conqueſt is abominable</hi> Hypocriſie <hi>before God and Man.</hi>
